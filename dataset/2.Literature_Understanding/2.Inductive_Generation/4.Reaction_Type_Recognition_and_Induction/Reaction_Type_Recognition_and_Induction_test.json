As shown in cycle A, the C�N double bond of 2H-azirine was first activated via the coordination through the nitrogen of 2Hazirine to Zn(II). Meanwhile, NaOH was used to promote the enolization of acetone. The two activated species underwent the Mannich reaction to form aziridine B, which can rearrange to enamine C through the ring-opening/isomerization process.Following the intramolecular condensation of C and dehydration of D, product 3 was obtained. Alternatively, the formation of 3-oxazoline was explained by cycle B: the carbonyl group of the acetone was polarized under acidic conditions (E). The 2H-azirine subsequently served as a nucleophile to react with the activated acetone to give the N,Oacetal intermediate F, which could form the azaallyl cation G upon opening of the three-membered ring. And the hydroxy group served as a nucleophile to attack the azaallyl cation to give the protonated 3-oxazoline H. Finally, 3-oxazoline 4 was delivered via the deprotonation process with regeneration of TfOH.\"", "answer": "Addition reaction"}
