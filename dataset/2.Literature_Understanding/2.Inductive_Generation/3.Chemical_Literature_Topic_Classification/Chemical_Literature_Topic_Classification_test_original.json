The input is as follows: Phosphagermylenylidenes (R−P=Ge), as heavier analogs of isonitriles, whether in their free state or as complexes with a Lewis base, have not been previously identified as isolable entities. In this study, we report the synthesis of a stable monomeric phosphagermylenylidene within the coordination sphere of a Lewis base under ambient conditions. This species was synthesized by Lewis base-induced dedimerization of a cyclic phosphagermylenylidene dimer or via Me3SiCl elimination from a phosphinochlorogermylene framework. The deliberate integration of a bulky, electropositive N-heterocyclic boryl group at the phosphorus site, combined with coordination stabilization by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene at the low-valent germanium site, effectively mitigated its natural tendency toward oligomerization. Structural analyses and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that this unprecedented species features a P=Ge double bond, characterized by conventional electron-sharing π and σ bonds, complemented by lone pairs at both the phosphorus and germanium atoms. Preliminary reactivity studies show that this base-stabilized phosphagermylenylidene demonstrates facile release of ligands at the Ge atom, coordination to silver through the lone pair on P, and versatile reactivity including both (cyclo)addition and cleavage of the P=Ge double bond.", "answer": "Organic Chemistry"}

All compounds were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, compound 4aa exhibited the most potent activity. Further investigations revealed that 4aa could inhibit Factin ring generation, bone resorption, and osteoclast-specific gene expression in vitro. Western blot analyses demonstrated that compound 4aa abrogated the RANKL-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kB-signaling pathways.

{"query": " Here is an assignment that requires you to classify chemistry literature. The input is as follows: Due to the increased concern about energy and environmental issues, significant attention has been paid to the development of large-scale energy storage devices to facilitate the utilization of clean energy sources. The redox flow battery (RFB) is one of the most promising systems. Recently, the high cost of transition-metal complex-based RFB has promoted the development of aqueous RFBs with redox-active organic molecules. To expand the working voltage, computational chemistry has been applied to search for organic molecules with lower or higher redox potentials. However, redox potential computation based on implicit solvation models would be challenging due to difficulty in parametrization when considering the complex solvation of supporting electrolytes. Besides, although ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) describes the supporting electrolytes with the same level of electronic structure theory as the redox couple, the application is impeded by the high computation costs. Recently, machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) has been illustrated to accelerate AIMD by several orders of magnitude without sacrificing the accuracy. It has been established that redox potentials can be computed by MLMD with two separated machine learning potentials (MLPs) for reactant and product states, which is redundant and inefficient. In this work, an automated workflow is developed to construct a universal MLP for both states, which can compute the redox potentials or acidity constants of redox-active organic molecules more efficiently. Furthermore, the predicted redox potentials can be evaluated at the hybrid functional level with much lower costs, which would facilitate the design of aqueous organic RFBs.", "answer": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry"}

The input is as follows: The development of potential-resolved electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems with dual emitting signals holds great promise for accurate and reliable determination in complex samples. However, the practical application of such systems is hindered by the inevitable mutual interaction and mismatch between different luminophores or coreactants. In this work, for the first time, by precisely tuning the oxygen reduction performance of M−N−C single-atom catalysts (SACs), we present a dual potential-resolved luminol ECL system employing endogenous dissolved O2 as a coreactant. Using advanced in situ monitoring and theoretical calculations, we elucidate the intricate mechanism involving the selective and efficient activation of dissolved O2 through central metal species modulation. This modulation leads to the controlled generation of hydroxyl radical (·OH) and superoxide radical (O2 ·−), which subsequently trigger cathodic and anodic luminol ECL emission, respectively. The well-designed Cu−N−C SACs, with their moderate oxophilicity, enable the simultaneous generation of ·OH and O2 ·−, thereby facilitating dual potential-resolved ECL. As a proof of concept, we employed the principal component analysis statistical method to differentiate antibiotics based on the output of the dual-potential ECL signals. This work establishes a new avenue for constructing a potentialresolved ECL platform based on a single luminophore and coreactant through precise regulation of active intermediates.", "answer": "Analytical Chemistry"}

The input is as follows: Introducing helical subunits into negatively curved π-systems has a significant effect on both the molecular geometry and photophysical properties; however, the synthesis of these helical π-systems embedded with nonbenzenoid subunits remains challenging due to the high strain deriving from both the curvature and helix. Here, we report a family of nonalternant nanographenes containing a nitrogen (N)-doped cyclopenta[ef]heptalene unit.Among them, CPH-2 and CPH-3 can be viewed as hybrids of benzoannulated cyclopenta[ef]heptalene and aza[7]helicene. The crystal structures revealed a saddle geometry for CPH-1, a saddlehelix hybrid for CPH-2, and a twist-helix hybrid for CPH-3. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the saddle moieties in CPHs undergo flexible conformational changes at room temperature, while the aza[7]helicene subunit exhibits a dramatically increased racemization energy barrier (78.2 kcal mol−1 for CPH-2, 143.2 kcal mol−1 for CPH-3). The combination of the nitrogen lone electron pairs of the N-doped cyclopenta[ef]heptalene unit with the twisted helix fragments results in rich photophysics with distinctive fluorescence and phosphorescence in CPH-1 and CPH-2 and the similar energy fluorescence and phosphorescence in CPH-3. Both enantiopure CPH-2 and CPH-3 display distinct circular dichroism (CD) signals in the UV− vis range.

Most naturally occurring glycosides were isolated from plants and bacteria; however, the chemical diversity of glycosylated natural products in fungi remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a paradigm to specifically discover diverse and bioactive glycosylated natural products from fungi by combining tailoring enzyme-guided genome mining with mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolome analysis. Through in vivo genes deletion and heterologous expression, the first fungal Cglycosyltransferase AuCGT involved in the biosynthesis of stromemycin was identified from Aspergillus ustus. Subsequent homology-based genome mining for fungal glycosyltransferases by using AuCGT as a probe revealed a variety of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) containing its homologues in diverse fungi, of which the glycoside-producing capability was corroborated by highperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis. Consequently, 28 fungal aromatic polyketide C/Oglycosides, including 20 new compounds, were efficiently discovered and isolated from the three selected fungi. Moreover, several novel fungal C/O-glycosyltransferases, especially three novel α-pyrone C-glycosyltransferases, were functionally characterized and verified in the biosynthesis of these glycosides. In addition, a proof of principle for combinatorial biosynthesis was applied to design the production of unnatural glycosides in Aspergillus nidulans. Notably, the newly discovered glycosides exhibited significant antiviral, antibacterial, and antidiabetic activities. Our work demonstrates the promise of tailoring enzyme-guided genome-mining approach for the targeted discovery of fungal glycosides and promotes the exploration of a broader chemical space for natural products with a target structural motif in microbial genomes.", "answer": "Natural Products"}

The input is as follows: Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods were applied to systematically investigate the temperature-dependent phosphorescence emission of dibenzo[b,d] thiophen-2-yl(4-chlorophenyl)methanone (ClBDBT) and its derivatives. The calculated temperaturedependent spectra on the lowest triplet state (T1) are in good agreement with the experimental observations, which means that the two-component white light emission should stem from the T1 state. The further MD simulations demonstrate the existence of two mesomerism structures at room temperature which can emit two lights simultaneously. The multi-component light emissions induced by mesomerism structures have advantages in balancing the distribution of excitons which could be beneficial to obtain pure white light along with stable Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) ´ coordinates.

Herein, a new type of core–shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the stability of this tri-thorium cluster. The model involves a 3c–2e bond in the Th3 core and a multicentered (ThCl2)3 charge-shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. To differentiate the strengths of the 3c–2e bond and the charge-shift bond, the block-localized wavefunction (BLW) method which falls into the ab initio valence bond (VB) theory is employed to construct a strictly core/shell localized state and its contributing covalent resonance structure for the Th3 core bond. By comparing with the σ-aromatic H3 + and nonaromatic Li3 +, the computed resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies confirm that this Th3 core bond is truly delocalized and σaromatic.", "answer": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry"}

Two-photon photodynamic therapy (TP-PDT) as a less invasive technique provides a new perspective for tumor treatment due to its low-energy near-infrared excitation, high targeting, and minor damage. At present, the emerging metal complexes used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in TP-PDT have aroused great interest.However, most metal complexes as PSs in TP-PDT still face some problems, such as slow clearance, unsatisfactory two-photon absorption (TPA) characteristics, high price, low reactivity, and poor solubility. In this work, density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory were used to characterize the one/two-photon response, solvation free energy, and lipophilicity of a series of novel PSs applied in TP-PDT.The results suggest that based on complex 1, replacing Ru(II) center with Zn(II) (complex 2) can effectively prolong the triplet excited state lifetime while reducing the cost and environmental pollution, and the azetidine heterospirocycles were introduced into the ligand scaffold (complex 3), which effectively reduced the vibration relaxation of the ligand group and improved the water solubility; further, the addition of acetylenyl groups subtly enhanced the light absorption and significantly improved the two-photon response (complex 4). In addition, all complexes met the requirement of a PS and could be used as potential candidates for TP-PDT. In particular, complex 4 has the advantages of high solvation free energy, a large TPA cross-section (1413 GM), a long triplet state lifetime (671 μs), good chemical reactivity, and low cost, and it is easy to be scavenged by organisms.
