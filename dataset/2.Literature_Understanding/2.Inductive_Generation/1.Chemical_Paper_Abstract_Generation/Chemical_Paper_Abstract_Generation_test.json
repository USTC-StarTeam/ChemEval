However, the divergent synthesis of enantioenriched cyclobutane derivatives with various structural patterns continues to be a significant challenge. Here, we disclose a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of cyclobutenes, resulting in a series of hydroarylation and 1,2- and 1,3-diarylation products via the interceptions of a common Heck intermediate. Mechanistic investigations provide valuable insights into understanding the catalytic mode of the palladium catalysts and the observed variations in the deuterium-responsive behavior during reactions. Furthermore, the synthetic utility is demonstrated in the syntheses of deuterated drug candidate belaperidone skeletons and pseudosymmetrical truxinic acid-type derivatives.\nINTRODUCTION\nAn\"escape from flatland\" strategy highlights the numbering of the carbon bond saturation and the chiral carbon within a molecule correlates with success as a bioactive chemical entity. $^{1,2}$ In this context, aliphatic small rings, including cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, have been increasingly investigated in medicinal chemistry for their beneficial physicochemical properties. $^{3}$ As depicted in Figure 1A, cyclobutanes containing multiple contiguous chiral centers have demonstrated appealing bioactivities. There are three different substitution patterns in these molecules: 1,2,3trisubstituted(PatternA),1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted(Pattern B), and 1,2,3,3-tetrasubstituted (Pattern C) cyclobutanes.\nAlthough enantioselective [2 + 2]-photocycloaddition is a straightforward strategy to access chiral cyclobutane derivatives, $^{4-10}$ the structural diversity is limited, as it generally requires two alkenes with matched electronic and steric properties. From a synthetic perspective, the precise functionalization of common cyclobutene derivatives11 could enable a divergent approach to prepare four-membered ring molecules with versatile chemical structure space. As a class of readily available carbocycles, cyclobutene has been used to synthesize enantioenriched cyclobutane derivatives with the catalysis of Cu, $^{12,13}$ Pt, $^{14}$ Rh, $^{15,16}$ and Co. $^{17}$ An elegant rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric addition of cyclobutenes with arylboronic acids has been reported to provide hydroarylation product Pattern A cyclobutanes, $^{15}$ and a highly enantioselective difunctionalization of cyclobutenes for the syntheses of Pattern B and C cyclobutanes is still underdeveloped.\nOn the other hand, difunctionalization of alkenes has become an efficient and formidable strategy for the assembly of complex molecules in a single step. $^{18-21}$ In addition, the chainwalking strategy provided a direct method to functionalize the unreactive C-H bonds by letting the catalyst move along the hydrocarbon chain of the substrate. $^{22-24}$ Despite the fact that the transition-metal-catalyzed 1,2-difunctionalization of strained cyclic alkenes has been disclosed, $^{25-31}$ the enantioselective three-component coupling reaction of strained alkenes has yet to be developed.\nHere, we report our work on palladium-catalyzed divergent enantioselective functionalization of strained alkene cyclobutene to the assembly of the above multisubstituted Pattern A-C cyclobutanes (Figure 1B). Starting from a common chiral Heck intermediate (M-1), the reduction with hydride donors provides hydroarylation products (Pattern A). Alternatively, the interception with arylboronic acids and tetraarylborates leads to the corresponding 1,3- and 1,2-diarylation products(Patterns C and B). A modified P-chiral ligand was critical for the success of these divergent reactions in terms of both reactivity and enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism and origin of stereoselectivity are elucidated using\n12691\nArticle\nA. Selected bioactive molecules with various substitution patterns\ndeuterium labeling experiments and density functional theory(DFT) calculations.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nReaction Optimization and Substrate Scope. We commenced our studies with the palladium-catalyzed reductive Heck reaction of cyclobutene ia with aryl bromide, using $HCO_{2}$ Na as a hydride source and i-PrOH as a solvent (Table 1). Together with hydroarylation product 2a, a detectable amount of byproduct 2a' was observed when arylphosphine ligand $PPh_{3}$ or BINAP was used (for more details, see Table S1). We assumed the formation of 2a' involved a facile arylaryl exchange between the palladium center and the phosphine ligand in palladium complexes. $^{32,33}$ Therefore, a set of ligands other than diaryl phosphines was screened (Table S2). Among them, SadPhos $(L-4)^{34}$ and Bi-BIME $(L-5)^{35}$ gave product 2a in 15-21$\\%$ ee. Further optimization using SadPhos ligands afforded cyclobutane 2a in 58-61$\\%$ ee (Table S3). More promising results were obtained when using the structural modification of Bi-BIME ligands, and the enantioselectivity\n12692\nArticle\ncould be enhanced to 76$\\%$ when P-chiral ligand L-6 and aryl iodide were used at $60^{\\circ}C$ (Tables S4-S8). After optimization of the reaction parameters (Table S9), the hydroarylation of 1a with 4-iodotoluene using $Pd_{2}dba_{3}\\cdot$ in EtOH provided product 2a in 82$\\%$ yield and 91$\\%$ ee at $40 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} .$\nWith optimal conditions of the reductive Heck reaction identified, a survey showed that a variety of iodoarenes were compatible, affording the corresponding products 2 in good yields and enantioselectivities (Table 2). Both electronwithdrawing and electron-donating para-substituted phenyl iodides were tolerated, giving products 2b-2k in moderate to good yields and 81-96$\\%$ ee. Notably, in the cases of electronwithdrawing substituents (2h-2k: F, Cl, Br, and $CO_{2}$ Me), enantioselectivity and yield could be improved when hydroarylation was conducted using Pd(TFA) $_{2}$ as a catalyst and isopropanol as a solvent. In addition, meta- or disubstituted phenyl iodides were also evaluated, and the corresponding products 21-2o could be furnished in 89-91$\\%$ ee. Moreover, the reaction of la with 2-naphthyl and heteroaromatic iodides also worked, affording products 2p-2r in 81-92$\\%$ ee.\nInspired by the above enantioselective reductive Heck reaction, we envisioned that the interception of Heck intermediates M-1 with arylboronic acids would provide the diarylation products. $^{36-38}$ Intriguingly, instead of 1,2-arylation products 4, the three-component coupling reaction provided 1,3-diarylation cyclobutanes 3 as the major products, which were probably formed via a chain-walking process (vide infra). Good enantioselectivity could be obtained with $Cs_{2}CO_{3}$ as a base and t-amyl alcohol as a solvent after slight alteration of the reductive Heck reaction conditions (Tables S10-11).\nThe scope of arylboronic acids with p-methoxyphenyl iodide is summarized in Table 3. Variations of the electronic properties and positions of the substituents on the phenyl ring of arylboronic acids had little impact on the enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivities of products 3a-3i were in the range of 93-95$\\%$. Notably, good reactivity was\n12693\nArticle\n$^{a}$ Conditions: 1a (0.1 mmol), Ar-I (0.3 mmol), $Pd_{2}dba_{3}\\cdot$ mol$\\%$), L-9(20mol$\\%$), $HCO_{2}$ Na, and EtOH at $40 \\space ^{\\circ}C. \\space ^{b}$ Pd(TFA $)_{2}(15$ mol$\\%$), i-PrOH, and $S0 \\space ^{\\circ}C$ were used.\nobserved with sterically demanding ortho-methylphenyl boronic acid (3i,50$\\%$,94$\\%$ ee). In addition, disubstituted phenylboronic acids, heteroarylboronic acids, and 2-naphthylboronic acid provided the corresponding products 3j-3n in 91-94$\\%$ ee.\nWe then examined the effect of the electronic properties of iodoarenes and aryboronic acids. In the cases of phenyl iodide and p-tolyl iodide, electron-rich and -deficient arylboronic acids were tolerated, furnishing products 3o-3t in 91-94$\\%$ ee. For p-methoxycarbonyl phenyl iodide, both electron-deficient and electron-rich arylboronic acids were compatible, giving products 3u-3w with enantioselectivity in the practical range of 79-84$\\%$ ee. The absolute structure of 3r was unambiguously determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis.\nThe scope of aryl iodides was investigated as well for 1,3arylation reactions of cyclobutene 1a with p-methoxycarbonyl phenylboronic acids. The enantioselectivities were in the range of 86-96$\\%$ for a variety of iodoarenes, including electronwithdrawing and electron-donating para-substituted phenyl iodides (3x-3ab), meta- and disubstituted phenyl iodides(3ac-3ae),2-naphthyl iodide(3af),and heteroaryl iodides(3ag and 3ah).\nFurthermore, the reaction with vinyl boronic acids instead of arylboronic acids was also surveyed. Under 1,3-arylation conditions, products 3ai and 3aj were obtained smoothly in 65-66$\\%$ yield with 90-91$\\%$ ee. The absolute structure of 3ai was corroborated by single-crystal X-ray analysis.\nWe speculated that a facile and efficient interception of Heck intermediates with more reactive nucleophiles other than arylboronic acids might override a chain-walking process, thus affording 1,2-diarylation products. Although arylzinc reagents failed to give any detectable diarylation products, sodium tetraarylborates turned out to be good nucleophiles for the desired 1,2-diarylation. $^{39}$ Optimal conditions were identified after the alteration of two reaction parameters, namely, the base and solvent (Table S12). The palladium-catalyzed\n12694\nAmylOH at $40^{\\circ}C.^{b}K_{3}PO_{4}$ was used. $^{c}$ Pd(TFA) $_{2},K_{3}PO_{4},50^{\\circ}C.$ $^{d}$ Pd(TFA) $_{2}$ , $Cs_{2}CO_{3},50 ^\\circ\\text{C} .$\nreaction of la with 4-iodotoluene and sodium phenylborate provided product 4a in 69$\\%$ yield and 91$\\%$ ee when $K_{3}PO_{4}$ was used as a base and t-BuOH as a solvent (Table 4). A survey of the substrate scope of iodoarenes revealed that electrondonating para-substituted phenyl iodides were applicable to optimal conditions, affording products 4b-4e in moderate to good yields and 86$\\%$ ee. Lower reactivity and enantioselectivity were observed in the cases of electron-withdrawing substituents, and the products (4f, F, 82$\\%$ ee; 4g, $CO_{2}$ Me, 60$\\%$ee) were obtained at a slightly higher temperature. Iodoarenes with a variety of substitutions, including meta-and disubstituted phenyl iodides, were also tolerated, giving the corresponding products 4h-4k in good yields and 88-93$\\%$ ee. The catalyst loading could be reduced when the reaction was scaled up to 5 mmol, and product 4i was isolated in 99$\\%$ yield with 91$\\%$ ee. In addition, 2-naphthyl or heteroaromatic iodides were also examined, and the reaction yielded the products 4l and 4m in 86-94$\\%$ ee. Moreover, a group of sodium tetraarylborates was also investigated. Both para-fluorophenyl and meta-methylphenyl groups were efficiently installed on the cyclobutane moiety, generating the 1,2-diarylation products 4n and 4o in 91-92$\\%$ ee. However, the introduction of meta-methoxyphenyl and dibenzo[b,d]thiophen-2-yl groups failed, and no 1,2arylation took place under the above conditions. We assumed that increasing the solubility of sodium tetraarylborates might improve the reaction performance. Indeed, switching to dioxane as a solvent gave practical results (Table S13). The desired 1,2-arylation proceeded smoothly at $80 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ furnishing products 4p and 4q in good yields and 57-81$\\%$ ee.\nMechanism Studies. We next turned our attention to elucidating the mechanism of these transformations based on common Heck intermediate M-1. Deuterium labeling experiments were conducted for the reductive Heck reaction (Figure 2). Starting from deuterium-labeled substrate 1a-D, product 2a-D-a with only one angular deuterium atom was obtained under standard conditions. Using $DCO_{2}$ Na as a hydride source provided product 2a-D-b, while using EtOD as a solvent gave product 2a-D-c. The reaction using both $DCO_{2}$ Na and EtOD gave product 2a-D-d in good yield. Similarly, the reaction of 1a could provide three deuterium-labeled products 2a-D-e-2a-Dg by employing $DCO_{2}$ Na or EtOD. Overall, we were able to prepare seven products with different deuterium-incorporated locations simply by replacing the deuterium reagents and substrate. It is now well-known that deuteration, a subtle structural modification, may improve the pharmacokinetic and/or toxicity profile of drugs. $^{40-42}$ Drug candidate belaperidone possesses a 6-aryl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane core, and we anticipate that the divergent introduction of deuterium atoms on the bicyclic skeleton potentially benefits drug discovery.\n1,3-Diarylation reactions with deuterium-labeled substrate la-D and/or deuterium solvent t-AmylOD were also examined, giving products 3a-D-a and 3a-D-b in good yields. Again, the deuterium atom could be introduced at position 7 when t-AmylOD was used. A H-D exchange between arylboronic and t-AmylOD was observed. In addition, the 1,2-diarylation reaction of 1a-D afforded product 4d-D with two angular deuterated atoms intact. These deuterium labeling\nArticle\n$^{a}$ Conditions:1a(0.1mmol),Ar-I(0.3mmol),Ar'-B(OH $)_{2}(0.3$ mmol), $Pd_{2}dba_{3}\\cdot$ mol$\\%$),L-9(20mol$\\%$), $Cs_{2}CO_{3}$ ,andt-\n12695\nexperiments indicated that the Heck intermediate underwent a chain-walking process to afford the angular palladium intermediate in the reductive Heck reaction and 1,3-arylation. In addition, the formation of products with C7-D suggested that a facile exchange with deuterium alcoholic solvent occurred during the reaction.\nTo elucidate the origin of the enantioselectivity and reaction mechanism, the detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further conducted using a model reaction of cyclobutene 1a and p-methyl iodobenzene under standard conditions. $^{43}$ The Gibbs free energy of INT1A coordinated with two chiral phosphine ligands was set as the reference zero point in the calculated energy profile (Figure 3A). In the initial step, the oxidative addition of the C-I bond of p-methyl iodobenzene to the Pd(0) center takes place. $^{44}$ This process through transition state TS2A requires overcoming a free energy barrier of 15.8 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ The resulting intermediate INT2A can dissociate one chiral phosphine ligand L-9, creating a vacant site around the palladium center to facilitate the subsequent migration insertion of substrate 1a (see the Supporting Information for details). The migratory insertion of cyclobutene is the enantiodetermining step, and the origin of\n12696\nArticle\n12697\nthe enantioselectivity can be elucidated by stereochemical models. The energy barrier of transition state TS4A-5S6R determining the observed 1R,5S,6R-configuration is 9.2 kcal $mol^{-1}$ relative to INT3A, which is lower in energy than that of transition states TS4A-5R6S, TS4A-5S6S, and TS4A-5R6R(9.2vs11.0,16.8,and27.5 $kcalmol^{-1}$ ;Figure3B). Furthermore, the noncovalent interactions between chiral ligands and the cyclobutene fragment in each enantiomer were investigated using an independent gradient model based on the Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) $.^{45}$ In the favorable transition state TS4A-5S6R, the presence of more $C-H \\cdots \\pi$ interactions effectively stabilizes the structure of the transition state, reducing the activation energy barrier and promoting the formation of chiral intermediates INT4A-5S6R. The calculated energy difference aligns with the observed enantiomeric excess(ee) of 91$\\%$ in the dominant formation of (1R,5S,6R)-2a. Excess formate anions replace the iodine ion in favored Heck intermediate INT4A-5S6R, leading to the formation of intermediate INT5A. Subsequently, intermediate INT5A undergoes two consecutive reversible ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfers (LLHT) $,^{46,47}$ forming angular palladium intermediate INT8A. During this process, the in situ-generated HCOOH readily undergoes rapid H-D exchange with the alcoholic solvent, allowing for hydrogen-deuterium exchange between the C7-H of the substrate and the solvent, which is consistent with the observations in deuterium labeling experiments. The following $\\beta -H$ elimination of INT8A occurs through transition state TS9A with an energy barrier of 12.9 kcal $mol^{-1},$ forming palladium hydride species INT9A while simultaneously liberating a molecule of carbon dioxide. Finally, after reductive elimination and ligand exchange, desired product (1R,5S,6R)-2a is obtained, along with the regeneration of active species INT1A, completing the catalytic cycle. By comparison, the direct $\\beta -H$ elimination of INT5A is kinetically unfavorable owing to the calculated higher energy barrier (18.8 vs 16.8 kcal $mol^{-1}$ relative to INT5A; see the Supporting Information for details). This observation is in complete agreement with the experimental phenomenon of the deuterium exclusively residing at the angular position when DCOONa is used.\nDFT studies further revealed strategies to control the regioselectivity of the reaction. A base is essential under the reaction conditions, as it facilitates the ligand exchange between PhB(OH) $_{2}$ and favored intermediate INT4A-5S6R.\n12698\nSimilar to the properties of sodium formate, phenylboronic acid salts can also promote the conversion of INT5B to INT8B within the developed reaction system (Figure 4A). The energy barrier of transition state TS9B is 5.5 kcal $mol^{-1}$ , significantly lower than that of TS6B(5.5 vs 22.4 kcal $mol^{-1})$ , indicating that $\\beta -$ carbon elimination of INT8B is kinetically favorable, which drives the reaction toward the formation of 1,3-diarylated product 3. This selective difference is mainly attributed to electronic effects. Natural population analysis(NPA) indicates that the amino group in the cyclobutyl skeleton of INT8B provides additional electron density to the metal center, making the Pd center relatively electron-rich and more prone to interact with the boron-linked phenyl ring, facilitating $\\beta -$ carbon elimination via TS9B. When sodium tetraarylborates with good nucleophilicity are used as the aryl source, they can directly undergo ligand exchange with INT4A-5S6R to generate INT6B, avoiding the pathway through higher-energy-barrier transition state TS6B and enabling the formation of desired 1,2-diarylated product 4(Figure 4B).\nFunctionalization. The further synthetic utility of the diarylation products was pursued by selective functionalization of the succinimide ring (Figure 5). It is worth noting that these transformations could be seen as the equivalents of functionalization of cyclobutenes $1b-1f.^{48}$ Treatment of 1,3-\nPMP\nCOOH\nCOOH\n$\\frac{KOH, \\space EtOH}{78 $\\%$ \\space yield}$ \\space  \\space CONHBn\\\\Ph \\space 1b CONHBn \\space PMP \\space $\\frac{LiA|H_{4}, \\space THF}{88 $\\%$ \\space yield}$ \\space PMP \\space NBn \\space NBn \\space ph \\space \\begin{matrix} P h \\\\ 6 \\end{matrix} \\space  \\space 3a \\space $BH_{3}\\cdot SMe_{2}$ ,THF \\space PMP \\space $\\frac{0 ^\\circ\\text{C} toreflux}{41 $\\%$ yield}$ \\space NBn \\space  \\space ph \\space 1d \\space 1.NaBH4 \\space i-PrOH $/H_{2}O$ \\space $\\begin{matrix}i&iPOOHHH_{2}O \\\\ 2&.Et_{3}OH,H_{O}A \\\\ \\frac{3.L_{A}AH_{4}F}{41 $\\%$ _{\\text{yield}}}\\\\\\text{over steps}\\end{matrix}$ \\space Ar \\space OH \\space -OH \\space NBn \\space OH \\space  \\space Ar:3,5-dimethylphenyl \\space Ar \\space $\\begin{matrix}BnNH_{2}\\\\ \\frac{EtOH,60 ^\\circ\\text{C}}{51 $\\%$ \\space yield}\\end{matrix}$ \\space Ar' \\space CONHBn \\space CONHBn \\space NBn \\space $\\square$ \\space Ph \\space Ph \\space CONHBn \\space 4h \\space 9 \\space 1f CONHBn \\space Ar': 3-methylphenyl \\space 12699 \\space Article \\space diarylation 3a with KOH gave ring-opening product 5 as a single regioisomer in 78$\\%$ yield. $^{49}A$ global reduction with $LiAlH_{4}$ provided 3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan 6 smoothly. Meanwhile, a partial reduction led to the formation of lactam 7 in 41$\\%$ yield. The synthetic utility of 1,2-diarlyation product 4 was also demonstrated. A three-step sequence of 4i gave diol 8 in 41$\\%$ over three steps. Treatment of succinimide 4h with benzylamine led to diamide 9 in 51$\\%$ yield. Notably, tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes 8 and 9 could be considered pseudosymmetrical truxinic acid-type derivatives.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we developed here a divergent palladiumcatalyzed desymmetrization of cyclobutene to access enantioenriched multisubstituted cyclobutanes with three substitution patterns. Three types of enantioselective reactions, including the reductive Heck reaction, 1,3-arylation, and 1,2arylation, were developed from the common Heck intermediate with the evolution of the P-chiral ligand. A variety of deuterated Heck reductive products could be obtained with the judicious choice of deuterated reagents and solvents, demonstrating its potential utility in medicinal chemistry. Combining the DFT calculation, the reaction mechanism was clearly elucidated. We envision that the investigation of the precise functionalization of the preformed four-membered ring skeleton could reveal more characteristic and valuable transformations with the development of a new methodology.\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c02215.\nDetailed experimental procedures and spectral data for all compounds (PDF)\nAccession Codes\nCCDC 2340760 and 2340761 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Despite the tremendous efforts devoted to this field, enantioselective aminative difunctionalization remains a challenge, particularly through an electrophilic addition fashion. Herein, we report an unprecedented approach for the enantioselective aminative difunctionalization of alkenes via copper-catalyzed electrophilic addition with external azo compounds as nitrogen sources. A series of valuable cyclic hydrazine derivatives via either[3+2] cycloaddition or intramolecular cyclization have been achieved in high chemo-, regio-, enantio-, and diastereoselectivities. In this transformation, a wide range of functional groups, such as carboxylic acid, hydroxy, amide, sulfonamide, and aryl groups, could serve as nucleophiles. Importantly, a new cyano oxazoline chiral ligand was found to play a crucial role in the control of enantioselectivity.\nnew chiral ligand broad scope high enantio-and diastereoselectivities\nINTRODUCTION\nEnantioselective difunctionalization of alkenes offers an ideal fashion for the rapid construction of valuable enantioenriched compounds by simultaneously incorporating two functional groups over the C-C double bond. Consequently, the development of new methods for such difunctionalization has been a long-standing goal in organic synthesis to meet the requirement of the synthesis of diverse chiral compounds. In this context, tremendous efforts have been made through either the metal- or main group element-catalyzed redox process as well as a radical pathway and so on in the past few decades. $^{1,2}$ Particularly, considerable attention has been paid to electrophile-promoted, catalytic enantioselective difunctionalization via a three-membered cyclic onium-ion intermediate since $2010.^{3}$ Normally, external electrophiles such as electrophilic chlorine, $^{4}$ bromine, $^{3b}$ iodine, sulfur, $^{3e-g}$ and selenium $reagents^{6}$ are utilized to interact with alkenes to form enantioenriched cyclic onium-ion intermediates under the assistance of chiral catalysts, followed by the attack of internal or external nucleophiles to generate the final chiral products(Scheme 1a, left). Due to the high reactivities of the onium-ion intermediates, a wide range of compounds or functional groups might serve as potential nucleophiles. This provides a good opportunity for the synthesis of 1,2-functionalized compounds with two contiguous stereogenic centers that cannot be easily accessed by other methods. Besides, this electrophilic reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance, and the utilization of unactivated alkenes. Despite these great advances, this reaction has remained a formidable challenge for application in aminative difunctionalization to form enantioenriched nitrogen-containing molecules by introducing an amino group (Scheme 1a, right).\nOur group has been working on electrophilic reactions. $^{3f,4b,8}$ As part of our continuous interest in it, electrophilic aminative difunctionalization of alkenes became our next goal. We proposed that enantioenriched nitrogen-containing molecules such as organic hydrazine derivatives might be formed via catalytic enantioselective electrophilic aminative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes using external azo compounds as nitrogen sources. We envisioned that an optically pure aziridinium-ion intermediate could be formed, $^{9}$ followed by a nucleophilic attack to produce the desired chiral hydrazine derivatives when a chirai catalyst could activate azo compound to form an electrophilic nitrogen species with an appropriate chiral environment. It is noted that organic hydrazine derivatives are of great importance. $^{10}$ They can serve as bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, and $agrochemicals^{11}$ and are used as chiral auxiliaries, $^{12}$ organocatalysts, $^{13}$ and important synthetic precursors for the synthesis of aza-heterocycles and amine derivatives. $^{14}$ However, to construct enantioenriched organic hydrazine derivatives, classical methods mainly focus on catalytic enantioselective $\\alpha -$ hydrazination of carbonyl $compounds^{15}$ and desymmetrization. Although aminative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most attractive\n7029\nvia:\nCO2Pr\nR=\nCu( $NTf_{2})_{2}/L$\nMe\n-Me\nPh\nMe\nAdditive\n$CO_{2}R$\nMe\n-Me\n。\n$\\begin{matrix}Me \\\\ \\leftarrow Me \\\\ Me \\end{matrix}$\n1a\n2\nSolvent, $30 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h$ Ph\nMe 3\n2a\n2b\n2c\n$\\begin{matrix}Me \\\\ 2d \\\\ 2d \\\\ \\hline \\end{matrix}$ Ph\\\\2e\n2f\nR'\nL1,R'=Me Me Me\nMe\nMe\n0.\nMe Me\nL2,R'=Et NC\nO\n0.\n0、\n0.\n。\n0.\n0\nL3,R'=iPr\nPh\nL4,R'=Ph L5, R'=H\nL6\nL7\nPh\nL8\nBn Ph\nL9\nPh\nL10\nPh\nPh\nL11\nPh\n7030\nArticle\n$^{a}$ Reaction conditions: 1(0.2mmol), 2a(0.21mmol), Cu( $NTf_{2})_{2}(10$ mol$\\%$), L1(11mol$\\%$), Fe(OTf $)_{3}(30$ mol$\\%$), 2-MeTHF(0.5mL) $, \\space 10^{\\circ}C$ , 24h.\nstrategies for rapid access to functionalized hydrazine derivatives, the successful studies usually focus on nonasymmetric transformations of $alkenes^{17}$ and the reactions of activated alkenes such as $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated carbonyl compounds via catalytic asymmetric nucleophilic addition $/ \\alpha -$ hydrazination of the carbonyl group sequence. $^{15b,18}$ No examples have been demonstrated for the catalytic enantioselective version of unactivated alkenes.\nHerein, we report our discovery that unactivated alkenes can undergo electrophilic aminative difunctionalization to generate enantioenriched hydrazine derivatives using dialkyl azodicarboxylates by Cu(II)/a new cyano oxazoline chiral ligand catalysis (Scheme 1b). Notably, this work not only provides a convenient route for the synthesis of chiral NN-containing compounds with two contiguous stereogenic centers but also opens an avenue for asymmetric difunctionalization of alkenes via an enantioenriched aziridinium-ion intermediate. Additionally, this study also discloses a new chiral cyano oxazoline ligand, which possesses potential in other metal-catalyzed asymmetric reactions.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nReaction Design and Optimization. Based on the aforementioned hypothesis, we initiated our study with transB-methylstyrene (1a) as a model substrate and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD, 2a) as a nitrogen source (Table 1). An unprecedented [3+2] cycloaddition reaction was expected to give the desired product through carbon-oxygen and carbon-nitrogen bond formation as well as the elimination of the isopropyl group. $^{19}$ Since chiral phosphoric acid could activate azo compounds to promote an electrophilic hydrazinative reaction, $^{16,20}$ it was utilized for this electrophilic addition reaction. Unfortunately, no desired product was generated at all, possibly because of the insufficient acidity of phosphoric acid.\nTo increase the acidity of the catalyst, strong metal Lewis acid was used. $^{15b,21}$ Surprisingly, it was found that Cu( $NTf_{2})_{2}$ could give the desired product in diethyl ether, albeit in a very low yield (entry 1). To promote the elimination of the isopropyl group, 19a different additives were attempted for the reaction. Fe(OTf) $_{3}$ was found to be effective in improving the yield of the reaction (entry 2). In the literature, bisoxazoline ligands were usually used in copper-catalyzed asymmetric reactions. $^{22}$ To adjust the coordination effect and chiral environment of oxazoline ligands, we tried to use an easily prepared unsymmetric chiral cyano oxazoline ligand for the reaction. $^{23}$ To our delight, the reaction gave the product in good yield with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities using indane-based methyl-substituted L1 bearing diaster-\n7031\nJ.

Without copper salt, Fe(OTf)3 itself could not promote the reaction efficiently (entry 4). Replacement of the methyl group with other groups on the ligand, such as ethyl, isopropyl, phenyl, and even hydrogen, did not result in better enantioselectivities (entries 5-8). Using oxazoline ligand L6 with gem-dimethyl groups, the reaction afforded the racemic product, indicating the importance of the hydrogen on the carbon connecting to the nitrile group (entry 9). Other amino-alcohol-derived ligands such as L7 and L8 were less effective than L1 (entries 10 and 11). In contrast, other frequently used chiral ligands in asymmetric transformations, such as phenyl-Box ligand L9, Pyox ligand L10, and PyBox ligand L11, were not effective for the current reaction (entries 12-14). They could not give better results even if the reaction were carried out under different reaction conditions. The reaction solvent had an impact on the reaction. When relatively weak coordination solvent 2methyltetrahydrofuran was utilized, the desired product was formed in high yields with slightly enhanced ee (entry 15). The reaction concentration affected the reaction slightly (entry 16). When the reaction temperature was lowered to $10 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ the enantioselectivity of the reaction was further improved (entry 17). With a longer reaction time, the reaction gave the product in high yield with excellent ee (entry 18). Further lowering the reaction temperature, the reaction gave the product in diminished yield (entry 19). Furthermore, different azo compounds were tested under similar conditions. It was found that dipentan-3-yl azodicarboxylate (2b) gave a similar result (entry 20). However, sterically hindered azodicarboxylate 2c did not give the corresponding product, and ethylsubstituted azodicarboxylate 2d did not give the corresponding product ether due to the challenges associated with the removal of the ethyl group (entry 21). Benzyl- and allylsubstituted azodicarboxylates were effective in yielding the desired products in good yields with high ees (entries 22 and 23). It is noted that Fe(OTf)3 played an important role in this cyclization reaction. It not only improved the reactivity but also contributed to the improvement of the enantioselectivity of the reaction. Furthermore, no reaction took place under similar conditions using azobenzene instead of dialkyl azodicarboxylates.\n7032\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. 2024, 146, 7029-7038\nArticle\nScope of Asymmetric Aminative Difunctionalization. With the optimal conditions in hand, different styrene-type alkenes were examined (Scheme 2). First, the effect of alkyl substituents on the $\\beta$ positions of the alkenes was studied. It was found that the substrates with various alkyl groups could give the corresponding products in moderate to high yields with high enantioselectivities under the conditions (3b-3k, 76-95$\\%$ ee). Steric hindrance has an effect on the reaction. As steric hindrance increased, the enantioselectivities of the reactions decreased, i.e., 86$\\%$ ee for 3d and 76$\\%$ ee for isopropyl-substituted 3e. A wide range of functional groups were well tolerated under the conditions, such as vinyl, alkynyl, ether, ester, bromo, and sulfonamide groups (3f-3k). Next, the effect of the aryl substituents on the double bond was investigated. Different aryl-substituted alkenes proceeded smoothly to give the desired products in high yields with high ees (31-3q). Interestingly, the steric hindrance of the aryl groups did not affect the reaction. For example, the substrates with ortho-methyl and ethyl-substituted aryl alkenes generated the corresponding products in good yields with high ees (31, 88$\\%$,92$\\%$ee;3m,62$\\%$,85$\\%$ee).However,theenantioselectivity of the reaction was found to be sensitive to the presence of the group at the para position of the aryl group. For instance, para-fluorophenyl alkenes yielded the desired products in a lower enantioselectivity of 80$\\%$(3p). This method was suitable for the transformation of electron-rich naphthyl alkenes (3q). Pleasingly, the cyclic alkene worked well, providing a useful amino indanol derivative under the conditions (3r). It is noted that when the common 1,2-dialkylsubstituted alkenes were utilized as substrates, the reactions did not occur due to the low reactivities of these alkenes in comparison with those 1,2-aryl,alkyl-substituted alkenes. Furthermore, when trisubstituted alkenes were subjected to similar conditions, the corresponding products were obtained with excellent ees (3s-3u).\nThe success of the cycloaddition of alkenes with azocarboxylates encouraged us to explore the enantioselective hydrazinative cyclization of nucleophile-tethered alkenes. Gratifyingly, alkenes bearing a variety of tethered nucleophiles could undergo hydrazinative cyclization to produce the desired heterocyclic and carbocyclic products efficiently (Scheme 3). The reactions of homoallylic alcohols with azo compound 2a formed tetrahydrofurans in moderate to high yields with excellent ees (5a-5e). Since it is not necessary to eliminate the alkyl group on the azo compound, ethyl-substituted azocarboxylate 2d could be utilized as the nitrogen source to give the desired product in high yield with high ee (5a). This is different from the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, in which azocarboxylate 2d was not effective. Using hydroxyl-tethered trisubstituted alkenes as substrates, the reactions smoothly gave chiral tetrahydrofurans bearing a quantum carbon chiral center (5f and 5g). This method is suitable for the construction of six-membered chiral tetrahydrofuran (5h). The bulky tertiary alcohol group could serve as the nucleophile to give the desired product, still in excellent yield with excellent ee (5i). To our surprise, the phenolic hydroxyl group could also act as the nucleophile to generate the desired product without the direct electrophilic hydrazination of the phenol group (5j). This fact that electrophiles prefer to interact with the double bond rather than the tethered phenolic group on substrates is similar to these observations in the reactions with electrophilic sulfur and halo reagents. $^{3f,8b}$ Similarly, this method is also effective for the construction of enantioenriched five- and six-membered lactones and piperidines and fivemembered lactam by using the tethered carboxylic acid, sulfonamides, and amide groups as nucleophiles, respectively(5k-5s). Steric hindrance had a slight effect on the reactions(5m, 5o, and 5q). In addition, the aryl group could serve as a nucleophile as well. The corresponding carbocycle-containing products were obtained with excellent ee values (5t and 5u). It is noted that the iron salt needed to be added, and the reaction temperature and time and the concentration of substrates needed to be adjusted to achieve the best results in some cases. The absolute configuration of the products was determined to\n7033\nL:\nMe\nMe Me\nMe F\nMe\n$\\frac{Cu(NTf_{2})_{2}/L}{Fe(OTf)_{3},2-MeTHF \\\\ 30^{\\circ}C.12h}$\n。\n。\n0.\n0.\n1a\n2a\n$CO_{2}Pr$\n$30 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h$\nPh\nMe\nL1\\\\ 69$\\%$, 91$\\%$ ee\nL6\\\\45$\\%$, 0$\\%$ ee\nL12\\\\69$\\%$,0$\\%$ ee\nL13\\\\36$\\%$,0$\\%$ ee\n(b) Isomerization of ligand in different deuterium solvents\nMe\nMe、\ndeuterium solvent\n$CDCl_{3}$\nDMSO $-d_{6}$\nTHF $-d_{8}$\n$^{1}H$ NMR ratio/$\\%$ of L1:L1a\n>20:1\n1:2\n5:1\nL1\\\\dr=1:1\nL1a\n(c) Hammett study\n(e) Construction of aziridine from alkene\n1a\nstandard conditions\n3a\nvs\nvs\n2a\n$\\circ$\nMe\nH\n$_{+}^{13}$\nO\n1\n$CO_{2}Pr$\n$y=-2.999x \\\\ R^{2}=0.9971$\n0.199\nX\nMe\n$PrO_{2}C^{-}N_{N^{-}CO_{2}^{i}Pr}$\n2a\n3\n(d) Correlation between the ee value of 5k and the one of chiral ligand\n$\\overset{\\text{TMSOTf}}{CH_{2}Cl_{2}\\\\ n,12 \\space h}\\downarrow$\n|||\nCOOH\n$\\begin{matrix}Cu(NTf_{2})_{2}\\\\ L1+ent-L1 \\\\ \\hline 2a \\end{matrix}$\n$\\circ$\n$y=0.9455+0.088R^{2}=0.9955$\n。TMS\nPr\nHN\nCO2Pr\nPh\nPh\n4k\n$Et_{2}O,30 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h$\n$PrO_{2}C$\n$CO_{2}Pr$\n5k\n\\ominus OTf\n14,63$\\%$\n(f) Proposed mechanism\nCu( $NTf_{2})_{2}$\nMe\n$PrO_{2}C$\n$CO_{2}Pr$\n[ $Fe^{III}]$\n[Cu $\\parallel ]L*$\n$\\xrightarrow [syn]{[Fe^{lll}]}\\\\$ attack Ar=\nO\n3 or 5\nrL*\n2a\n[ $Fe^{III}]$\nCO2Pr\n[Cu $||]L^{*}$\n-Cu\"L*\nAr\n...H\n$CO_{2}Pr$\nO'Pr $Cu^{\\prime}L^{\\bigstar}$\n$CO_{2}Pr$\nMe\n$L^{*}\\\\ o-Cu^{\\parallel}$\nAr\n$CO_{2}Pr$\n$L^{*}=L1a$\nIII-A\nH\nIV-A\n3\nAr////\nH\nPro\n$CO_{2}Pr$\nCu'L*\nIII\n8+\n$PrO_{2}C$\nCullL*\n[ $Cu^{\\prime \\prime}]L*$\nNu-\n$PrO_{2}C$ 、 \\oplus \\space N- $CO_{2}Pr$ \\space Ar \\space R=alkyl \\space $\\overline{anti}$ \\space Ar \\space $\\cdots H$ \\space CO2Pr \\space attack \\space $CO_{2}Pr$ \\space $\\overset{Ar/1.}{H}$ \\space $PrO_{2}C$ \\space H \\space H-Nu \\space III-B \\space IV-B \\space 5 \\space be (2R,3S) based on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of product 5o. These results clearly show the generality of this method.\nSynthetic Transformation of the Products. To demonstrate the practicability of the developed method, a scale-up experiment and further transformations of the products were performed (Scheme 4). When 1.0 mmol of 1a was treated with azodicarboxylate 2a under similar conditions, 3a was still formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 4a). Due to the presence of the N-N moiety, the obtained products could be converted into various valuable enantioenriched nitrogen-containing compounds. For example, when 3a was treated with methyl bromoacetate under basic conditions, chiral oxazolidinone 6 was obtained in moderate yield via the N-N bond cleavage.24 According to the literature procedure, $^{25}$ oxazolidinone 6 could be transferred to the drug pseudoephedrine easily, highlighting the potential utility of our method in pharmaceutical synthesis. When 3a was treated with Lawesson's reagent, chiral thiooxazolidinone derivative 7 was formed efficiently via the O-S exchange reaction. Using lithium aluminum hydride, 3a could be reduced to $\\beta -$ hydroxyl hydrazine, followed by intramolecular transesterification to afford [1,3,4]-oxadiazinan-2-one derivative 8 successfully. In addition to 3a, other products could be converted, as well. For instance, intramolecular alkylation of bromide 3j resulted in the formation of chiral bicyclo hexahydropyridazine 9 in high yield (Scheme 4b). The ammonolysis of lactone 5k afforded the corresponding hydroxyl amide that could go through Hofmann rearrangement and cyclization to yield chiral hydrazinated 1,3-oxazinan-2-one\n7034\nArticle\n10 in good yield (Scheme $4c).^{26}$ Furthermore, aminated chiral piperidine 12, the precursor of potent orexin receptor antagonist 2-Epi-CP $-99,994,^{27}$ could be prepared via a N-N bond cleavage-deprotection-reductive amination sequence from hydrazinated piperidine 5r (Scheme 4d). It is worth mentioning that the enantioselectivities of the transformations mentioned above did not erode apparently.\nMechanistic Insight. To elucidate the mechanism of this asymmetric difunctionalization, control experiments and related reactions were conducted (Scheme 5). The effect of the ligand structure was further evaluated (Scheme 5a). Similar to the reaction using L6 without an $\\alpha -$ hydrogen as the ligand, the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction gave product 3a in good yield but with no enantioselectivity when $\\alpha -$ fluorinated L12 was utilized. In contrast, ligand L13, on which the cyano group on L1 was replaced with an ester group, could lead to the formation of the desired product in a low yield with no enantioselectivity. These results revealed that both the $\\alpha -$ hydrogen and the cyano group on the ligand are important for achieving high enantioselectivity. Owing to the strong electronwithdrawing effect of both the cyano group and the oxazoline group as well as the presence of $\\alpha -$ hydrogen, it was wondered whether ligand L1 could isomerize to other isomers (Scheme 5b). It was found that the tautomerism of ligand L1 could be verified by NMR, GC, and HPLC analysis. For example, when L1 was analyzed by NMR using deuterated chloroform or deuterated THF, the signals related to isomer Lla were observed via little isomerization of L1. This isomerization phenomenon was more pronounced using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent, resulting in the isomerization of more than half of L1 into L1a. This tautomerism phenomenon provides a possible explanation for why excellent enantioselectivity could still be achieved when L1 composed of two diastereoisomers was utilized as a ligand. Under the reaction conditions, ligand L1 might be isomerized to Lla to serve as a real chiral ligand. However, it is worth mentioning that ligand L5 with two $\\alpha -$ hydrogens is in a different case to lead to the formation of the desired product in quite low enantioselectivity(see entry 8 of Table 1). Possibly, this ligand might not be favorable to isomerize to the Lla analogue, a relatively less thermodynamic stable trisubstituted alkene.\nTo probe the electronic effect of the substrates on the reaction, a Hammett study was conducted on the basis of onepot competition experiments (Scheme 5c). A series of $\\beta -$ methylstyrenes were utilized for the asymmetric[3+2]cycloaddition reaction. The competition experiments using la and other substituted styrenes revealed that the substrates bearing electron-rich aryl groups were consumed more rapidly, with a good Hammett correlation $(\\rho =-2.7,R^{2}=0.93).$ The large and negative $\\rho$ value is consistent with the mechanism involving the addition of highly electrophilic aminative species onto the alkene. $^{28}$ In addition, the correlation between the enantiomeric purity of the ligand and that of the product was investigated. It was found that a linear correlation was observed in the hydrazinative lactonization of 4k (Scheme 5d). This result suggested that the monochiral ligand coordinated to the metal center is involved in the enantio-determining step. Furthermore, to prove the feasibility of formation of a threemembered aziridinium intermediate, sterically congested olefin 13 was treated with azodicarboxylate 2a and Lewis acid TMSOTf (Scheme 5e). Interestingly, isolable aziridine derivative 14 was formed along with the release of the ester group, possibly because of steric hindrance. The structure of compound 14 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. This result suggested that an aziridinium intermediate is possible to be formed in the reaction.9\nBased on the mechanistic studies, a feasible mechanism for the asymmetric difunctionalization of alkenes is depicted in Scheme 5f, left. First, chiral copper complex I is formed through the interaction between Cu( $NTf_{2})_{2}$ and the chiral ligand. It is speculated that the chiral ligand might serve as a bidentate one with both the $\\pi$ bond of the nitrile group and the nitrogen coordinated to the copper center. The formed copper complex activates azodicarboxylate 2a to generate electrophilic aminative species II. The reaction of II with an aryl alkene gives chiral aziridinium intermediate III by recognizing the face of the $\\pi$ bond. Then, the nucleophilic ring opening of III produces the desired product 3 or 5 and regenerates catalyst I. There are some differences in the ring opening of the aziridinium intermediate between [3+2] cycloaddition and hydrazinative cyclization. In[3+2] cycloaddition (Scheme 5f, right, top), external iron salt plays an important role in improving the yield and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The iron salt can bind to the carbonyl group on intermediate III to promote the elimination of propylene and the release of the copper complex catalyst. This step leads to the formation of intermediate IV-A. The following syn attack toward the aziridinium ring results in the formation of product 3. Based on the results in Table 1, the addition of iron salt significantly enhances the formation of intermediate IV-A and is beneficial to the following stereoselective nucleophilic ring opening. In hydrazinative cyclization (Scheme 5f, right and bottom), the iron salt is supposed to bind to the carbonyl group on intermediate III. Due to the presence of the tethered nucleophile on the alkene substrate, the nucleophilic ring opening by an anti attack is easy to give intermediate IV-B before the elimination of propylene. The following proton transfer gives final product 5. The binding of the iron salt is helpful for the slight improvement of enantioselectivity of the reaction in some cases but not necessary in some cases. Therefore, it is not necessary to add the iron salt in some cases to achieve a high enantioselectivity of the reaction.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have developed an efficient approach to realize the enantioselective aminative difunctionalization of alkenes via an electrophilic addition fashion. A wide range of enantioenriched hydrazine derivatives are achieved in excellent chemo-, regio-, enantio-, and diastereoselectivities. To accomplish this transformation, dialkyl azodicarboxylates are utilized as electrophilic nitrogen sources, and a new chiral cyano oxazoline compound serves as an efficient chiral ligand. Furthermore, further derivatization of the obtained products toward different types of valuable nitrogen-containing compounds indicates the practical value of this methodology. This work showcases that an enantioenriched aziridinium-ion intermediate can be formed directly from the reaction of alkenes with nitrogen-containing compounds. It pushes the boundaries of the enantioselective electrophilic addition reaction of alkenes using a hard electrophile, providing an opportunity for the construction of chiral nitrogen-containing molecules.\n7035\nArticle\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c00307.\nExperimental details; characterization data; HPLC traces; and NMR spectra of new compounds (PDF)\nAccession Codes\nCCDC 2249153-2249155 and 2249157-2249159 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

In this reaction, Cu(NTf2)2 acts as a strong Lewis acid to activate the azodicarboxylate reagent to form highly active electrophilic nitrogen species, which, in coordination with a newly developed cyanooxazoline chiral ligand, is able to bind to the π-bonds of the olefins and form ternary cycloazolium ionic intermediates in a highly enantioselective manner, which leads to [3+2] and intramolecular cyclisation transformations. The reaction is chemoselective, regioselective, enantioselective and diastereoselective with a wide range of nucleophilic groups. In order to understand the mechanism of the reaction, the authors carried out controlled experiments, among others. This study has achieved the asymmetric amination difunctionalisation reaction of olefins using a metal activation strategy and synthesised a series of optically pure hydrazine derivatives, which provides a new route for the construction of nitrogen-containing chiral molecules."}

However, their $\\alpha -C-H$ bonds are unreactive towards electrophiles due to their extremely low acidity ( $pK_{a}\\sim 57).$ Nonetheless, 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) can activate primary alkyl amines by increasing the acidity of the $\\alpha -$ amino C-H bonds by up to $10^{44}$ times. This makes the $\\alpha -$ amino C-H bonds acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions. By combining DFO with an iridium catalyst, direct asymmetric $\\alpha -C-H$ alkylation of $NH_{2}-$ unprotected primary alkyl amines with allylic carbonates has been achieved. This reaction produces a wide range of chiral homoallylic amines with high enantiopurities. The approach has successfully switched the reactivity between primary alkyl amines and allylic carbonates from intrinsic allylic amination to the $\\alpha -C-H$ alkylation, enabling the construction of pharmaceutically significant chiral homoallylic amines from readily available primary alkyl amines in a single step.\nChiral amines are widely found in various natural products, bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysts, making them incredibly $important^{12}.$ This has spurred the development of innova tive methodologies for synthesizing chiral $amines^{2}.$ One of the most effective techniques in organic synthesis is transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric allylic amination, which could serve as a reliable platform for producing chiral $amines^{3,4}.$ Primary alkyl amines are a commonly found chemical feedstock. They serve as excellent N-nucleophiles in transition-metal-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions, typically yielding higher-order amines (Fig. $1a)^{3,4}.$ However, if allylic substitution occurs on the $\\alpha -$ amino C-H bonds of primary alkyl amines, it would provide a straightforward and intriguing strategy for synthesizing chiral homoallylic amines (Fig. $1a)^{5}.$ These molecules are not only biologically significant (See Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information (SI) for selected examples of bioactive chiral homoallylic amines), but they can also serve as powerful building blocks for constructing nitrogen-containing $compounds^{6}.$ However, achieving this transformation is difficult. This is because the acidity of the $\\alpha -$ amino C( $sp^{3})-H$ bond is very low (with a pKa estimated to be -57 by calculation, see SI and Supplementary Data $1)^{7},$ making it challenging to deprotonate it into an active nucleophilic $carbanion^{8,9}.$ Additionally, the unprotected $NH_{2}$ group can seriously interfere with the $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation process (Fig. 1a). To prevent the interruption of the $NH_{2}$ group and facilitate $\\alpha -C-H$ deprotonation, protecting group strategies must be employed. The only successful example of such a strategy is reported by Niu et al, where they discover that imines, made from either 9H-fluoren-9-imine and an alkyl $amine^{10}$ or fluoren-9-amine and an alkyl $aldehyde^{11},$ can react with allylic electrophiles in the presence of an iridium catalyst (Fig. 1b). This reaction forms linear chiral homoallylic amines upon hydrolysis. The reaction proceeds via a pathway involving an ir-catalyzed allylic substitution on the fluorenyl carbon and subsequent 2-aza-Cope rearrangement, ultimately resulting in formal $\\alpha -C$ ( $sp^{3})-H$ allylic alkylation of primary amines. The strategy is also effective for activated $substrates^{12-15}.$ Although stoichiometric fluorenone or fluoren-9-amine is used, these elegant studies represent an important early advance in the area. If without protecting group manipulations to the active $NH_{2}$ group, direct asymmetric $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation of $NH_{2}-$ unprotected primary alkyl\nArticle\namines would be especially synthetically attractive, regarding atomand step- $efficiencies^{i6-19}.$ However, developing this transformation is highly challenging and has not yet been achieved.\nCarbonyl catalysis is a process that uses an appropriate aldehyde or ketone to catalyze $\\alpha -C-H$ functionalization of primary amines with electrophiles, constructing chiral amines in just one step (Fig. $1C)^{20-25}$ Although a series of asymmetric transformations have been achieved by using chiral pyridoxals as carbonyl $catalysts^{23},$ the strategy is mainly limited to activated primary amines such as $glycinates^{20,26,27}$ , $benzylamines^{28},$ and propargylic $amines^{29}$ (Fig. 1c). The reason for this limitation is that primary alkyl amines are highly inert for $\\alpha -C-H$ transformation towards electrophiles due to their extremely low acidity ( $pK_{a}\\sim 57).$ Thus, more powerful carbonyl catalysts are required to activate primary alkyl amines. After considering this challenge, we discover that 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (4, DFO) $^{30}$ can effectively activate primary alkyl amines by forming imines. The acidity of the $\\alpha -$ amino C-H bonds is improved by up to $10^{44}$ times, making it acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 8). The strong electron-withdrawing property of the $14 \\pi -$ electron system of the diazafluorene accounts for its extraordinary activating power. Furthermore, in the presence of an iridium catalyst, allylic carbonates can become active electrophiles for allylic $alkylation^{31-35}.$\n2\nHerein, by combining the iridium catalysis and the DFO $catalysis^{36-45},$ we have successfully achieved direct asymmetric $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation of $NH_{2}-$ unprotected primary alkyl amines 1 with allylic carbonates 2, producing a broad variety of chiral homoallylic amines 3 in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to 95$\\%$ yield, 98$\\%$ ee or 99:1 dr) (Fig. 1d). The reaction undergoes asymmetric allylic substitution on the diazafluorenyl carbon first and then 2aza-Cope rearrangement, resulting in formal $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation of primary amines without the protection of the strongly nucleophilic $NH_{2}group^{46}.$\nResults\nOptimization studies\nThe studies began by searching for efficient carbonyl catalysts that could activate primary alkyl amines (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). When the catalyst Ir(COD) $_{2}BF_{4}/(R,R,R_{a})-L1$ was utilized to activate allylic carbonate 2a, several electron-withdrawing aldehydes 5-8 and ketones 4 and 9 were evaluated in the reaction of 2a and primary amine 1a. Only diazafluorenone 4 (DFO) was found to be capable of promoting the desired $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation of 1a, resulting in the formation of chiral homoallylic amine 3a in 87$\\%$ yield with 92$\\%$ ee. The Ir(COD) $_{2}BF_{4}/(R,R,R_{a})-L1$ complex controlled the enantioselectivity of the reaction. When phosphoramidite ligand $(R,R_{a})-L6$ was applied, the enantioselectivity was further improved to 97$\\%$ ee. Without the presence of DFO or iridium catalyst, the $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation did not occur at all (Supplementary Table 1, entries 1 and 2). It was observed that the addition of a small amount of water to the solvent, tetrahydrofuran, was crucial for enhancing the reaction efficiency(Supplementary Table 1, entry 32 vs 24). It was believed that water facilitated the hydrolysis of the imine between 3a and 4, thus accelerating the release of alkylation product 3a and the regeneration of carbonyl catalyst 4 (DFO). In the absence of $ZnBr_{2},$ classic allylic amination occurred predominantly (Supplementary Table 1, entry 3 vs 4). The additive $ZnBr_{2}$ acted as a Lewis acid, promoting the condensation of alkyl amine 1a with diazafluorenone 4 to form an imine that initiated the transformation. Additionally, $ZnBr_{2}$ also likely inhibited the undesired allylic amination of 1a by coordinating with the NH2 group.\nScope of the reaction\nUnder the optimized conditions, we investigated the substrate scopes of both reaction partners (Fig. 3). In the presence of catalytic amounts of Ir(COD) $_{2}BF_{4}/(R,R_{a})-L6$ and diazafluorenone 4, various cinnamyl (for 3a-n), naphthyl (for 3o), heteroaryl (for 3p-q), and dienyl carbonates(for 3r-t) smoothly reacted with primary alkyl amine 1a, producing $\\alpha -$ substituted chiral amines 3a-t in moderate to high yields (48-95$\\%$) with high enantioselectivities (80-97$\\%$ ee). However, aliphatic allylic carbonates such as (E)-hex-2-en-1-yl methyl carbonate are ineffective for the a allylic alkylation of primary amines, mainly because the corresponding intermediates generated from the Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution cannot smoothly undergo the 2-aza-Cope rearrangement to form the linear homoallylic amines under the standard conditions. The reaction was also applicable to a broad range of primary alkyl amines. Simple alkyl amines such as ethylamine (for 3v), n-propylamine (for 3w), and n-butylamine (for 3u and 3x), as well as those bearing diverse substituents (for 3ae-ao), displayed good activity (50-87$\\%$ yields) and excellent enantioselectivity (91-98$\\%$ ee) in the reaction.

Secondary amines such as 2-butylamine and cyclohexylamine were inert for the $\\alpha -$ C-H allylic alkylation likely due to steric effect and a lower acidity. Primary alkyl amines bearing one or more chiral moieties underwent $\\alpha -$ C-H allylic alkylation to afford the corresponding chiral amines 3ap-ba with high diastereoselectivities. Functional groups, such as acetal (for 3ae), lactam (for 3af), NHBoc (for 3ak-ao), OH (for 3ah-aj, 3ap-ar, and 3ba), and ester (3av), were all well tolerated by the reaction. It is especially impressive that for amino alcohols (for 3ah-aj, 3ap-ar, and 3ba) containing one or two much more acidic O-H groups, the alkylation still occurred on the highly inert $\\alpha -C-H$ bonds.\nSynthetic utility\nThe reaction can be scaled up to gram scale, even with a lower catalyst loading (Fig. 4a). When 2 mol$\\%$ Ir(COD) $_{2}BF_{4}/(R,R_{a})-L6$ was used, 1.675g of chiral homoallylic amine 3w was obtained from n-propylamine and allylic carbonate 2b in 82$\\%$ yield with 93$\\%$ ee. The products, 3, which were obtained from the $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation, have demonstrated their synthetic usefulness through various transformations of\n4\nArticle\nbenzyloxycarbonyl, EDCI 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydro-\nchloride, HOBt 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, DIPEA diisopropylethylamine.\n5\nArticle\ncompound 3w, as shown in Fig. 4a. For instance, hydrogenation of 3w resulted in chiral aliphatic amine 10 in 91$\\%$ yield. Reaction of 3w with $l_{2}$ produced chiral pyrrolidine 11 in 83$\\%$ yield and 3.7:1 dr, without any loss of enantioselectivityll. X-ray analysis confirmed that the major diastereomer was (2S,3R,5S)-11 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Treatment of 3w with tert-butyldicarbonate ( $Boc_{2}O),$ followed by asymmetric dihydroxylation, led to the formation of chiral amino diol 12 with high enantiopurity. Bioactive chiral bicyclic $compounds^{47},$ such as 14, can also be synthesized in 56$\\%$ total yield over two steps from compound 3s via intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction. Moreover, the asymmetric $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation can be used for the rapid synthesis of pharmaceuticals. For example, product 3ah underwent condensation with N-carbobenzyloxy-L-alanine, followed by hydrogenation of the C-C double bond and the carbobenzyloxy group, and subsequent condensation with acid 16, producing anti-Alzheimer's compound $17^{48}$ in 88$\\%$ total yield over three steps.\nMechanistic studies\nComputational studies have shown that forming imines with diazafluorenone 4 can significantly increase the acidity of the $\\alpha \\space C-H$ bonds of alkyl amines, by up to $10^{44}$ times (from $pK_{a}\\space 57$ of 1c to $pK_{a}\\space 12.5$ of 18c)(Fig.4b). This increased acidity allows for the deprotonation of the $\\alpha \\space C-H$ bonds under mild conditions, producing active 2-azaallyl $anions^{30,49}.$ Furthermore, the calculated Fukui index reveals that the $\\alpha '$ carbon of the delocalized carbanion 19c is more nucleophilic than the a $carbon^{50,51}$ (Fig. 4b). In addition, Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions typically result in branched $products^{31-35,52},$ while the current transformation displayed linear regioselectivity. These suggest that the transformation most likely began with Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution, which occurred on the $\\alpha$ carbon of the delocalized carbanion 19c, generating a branched intermediate that then underwent aza-Cope rearrangement to form the final linear product 3, as the pathway of the transformation reported by $Niu^{10,11}.$\nAn lridium/ketone dual catalysis pathway has been proposed(Fig. 4c). The condensation of alkyl amine 1 with diazafluorenone 4 yields imine 18, which is deprotonated at the $\\alpha \\space C-H$ bond to form 2-azaallyl anion $19^{49}.$ The delocalized carbanion 19 then undergoes asymmetric addition at the diazafluorenyl carbon to $(\\pi -$ ally)lr(III) species 24, generated from iridium complex 23 and allylic carbonate 2, resulting in the formation of branched intermediate 21 and the dissociation of the iridium catalyst 23. Subsequently, compound 21 undergoes 2-aza-Cope rearrangement followed by hydrolysis, leading to $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation product 3 and the regeneration of ketone catalyst 4. The proposed reaction pathway is in agreement with results from control experiments shown in Fig. 4d, where amine 25 reacted with 3-phenyl propanal to produce imine intermediate 21b, which underwent in situ 2-aza-Cope rearrangement and subsequent hydrolysis to yield amine 3b, the same product obtained from the current $\\alpha -$ C-H allylic alkylation of alkyl amine 1a with cinnamyl methyl carbonate(Fig. 4d). Kinetic isotope effect studies were performed using equimolar amounts of primary alkyl amines 1d and 1d-d (Fig. 4e). The ratio of products 3ad and deuterated 3ad-d was determined as 6.7:1, indicating that the deprotonation of imine 18 to form active 2-azaallyl carbanion 19 likely is the rate-determining step for the transformation. As shown in the proposed transition state 20 (Fig. 4c), the chiral environment of the $(\\pi -$ ally)lr(III) complex controls the approaching direction of the diazafluorenyl carbanion, determining the absolute configuration of the resulting adduct 21. The chirality of compound 21 is then transferred to the final product in a stereospecific way via 2-azaCope rearrangement, leading to the formation of chiral homoallylic amine 3 in high enantioselectivity.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, we have successfully developed a direct asymmetric $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation of $NH_{2}-$ unprotected primary alkyl amines through synergistic iridium/ketone catalysis, producing a wide range of chiral homoallylic amines in 48-95$\\%$ yields with excellent diastereoand enantioselectivities (up to 98$\\%$ ee and 99:1 dr) via asymmetric allylic substitution and in situ 2-aza-Cope rearrangement. The 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) catalyst displays extraordinary power in activating the inert $\\alpha -C-H$ bonds of alkyl amines, improving the acidity by up to $10^{44}$ times and leading to the asymmetric $\\alpha -C-H$ allylic alkylation. The reaction features excellent stereocontrol, good efficiency and a broad substrate scope, all while avoiding the need for protecting group manipulations and utilizing a simple catalyst system, which provides a straightforward and practical method for synthesizing pharmaceutically significant chiral homoallylic amines, from readily available alkyl primary amines.\nMethods\nGeneral procedure for catalytic asymmetric $\\alpha -C$ ( $sp^{3})--H$ allylic alkylation\nIn a glove box, to a dry 5-mL vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar were added Ir(COD) $_{2}BF_{4}(5.9$ mg,0.012 mmol $),(R,R_{a})-L6(8.8$ mg, 0.0132mmol), THF (0.20 mL) and primary amine 1 (0.15 mmol) (Note: Introducing a part of the primary amine 1 during the catalyst preparation is helpful for accelerating the formation of the active Ir catalyst) $^{53}.$ The vial was sealed and taken out of the glove box. The mixture was stirred at $50 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature, which was used as the solution of the Ir catalyst. In the glove box, to a 10 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar were added 1,8-diazafluoran-9-one (4, DFO) (5.5 mg, 0.030 mmol), THF (0.20 mL), primary amine 1 (0.30 mmol) and a solution of $ZnBr_{2}(0.101g$ , 0.45mmol) in THF (0.30 mL). The Schlenk tube was sealed and taken out of the glove box. After being stirred at room temperature for 30 min, to the mixture were added allylic carbonate 2 (0.30 mmol, dissolved in 0.40 mL dry THF), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene(DBU)(0.050g,0.33mmol), the pre-prepared solution of the Ir catalyst, THF (0.35 mL) and water (0.050 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 36 h. A hydroxylamine ( $NH_{2}$ OH) aqueous solution (0.050 mL, 50 wt$\\%$ in water) was added to quench the reaction. After stirring at room temperature for 1h, ammonium hydroxide solution (5.0 mL, 25-28 wt$\\%$ in water) was added and the resulting mixture was extracted with DCM (20 mL $\\times 3).$ The combined organic layers were dried over $Na_{2}SO_{4},$ fitered, concentrated under reduced pressure and purified via column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate: dichloromethane: triethylamine = 100:10:1, the silica gel column was eluted with 1$\\%$ v/v solution of $Et_{3}N$ in petroleum ether before sample loading) to afford compound 3. For some specific substrates, the reaction conditions were slightly changed, the detailed information of which can be found in the Si.\nData availability\nThe authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and Supplementary Information file, or from the corresponding author upon request.

Up to now, the major effort for macrolactonization is directed toward identifying suitable carboxylic acid/alcohol coupling reagents to address the challenges associated with macrocyclization, wherein the stereochemistry of products is usually controlled by the substrate's inherent chirality. It remains largely unexplored in using catalysts to govern both macrolactone formation and stereochemical control. Here, we disclose a non-enzymatic organocatalytic approach to construct macrolactones bearing chiral planes from achiral substrates. Our strategy utilizes N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as a potent acylation catalyst that simultaneously mediates the macrocyclization and controls planar chirality during the catalytic process. Macrolactones varying in ring sizes from sixteen to twenty members are obtained with good-to-excellent yields and enantiomeric ratios. Our study shall open new avenues in accessing macrolactones with various stereogenic elements and ring structures by using readily available small-molecule catalysts.\nMacrolactones, cyclic carboxylic esters with over twelve-membered rings, are broadly present in natural and synthetic functional $molecules^{1}.$ Representative examples of bioactive macrolactones include medicinally important macrolide antibiotics such as ery thromycin, and agrochemicals like avermectin and Spinosad(Fig. $1A)^{2-4}.$ The unique conformational (and configurational) properties posed by the macrocyclic structures are critical for these molecules to display the right $bioactivities^{5,6}.$ Therefore, the preparation of macrolactones has received significant attention over the past $decades^{17},$ and new synthetic methods continue to emerge in recent yearss,9.One class of such methods starts from substrates with carboxylic ester moieties pre-installed on the main chains and uses various transformations (such as those based on transition metalcatalyzed bond formations) to close the respective $macrocycles^{10-13}$ The other type of methods, primarily a classic strategy, relies on the formation of carboxylic esters from the corresponding carboxylic acids and alcohols as the ring-closing step (Fig. $1B)^{14-18}.$ Indeed, this lactonization method still constitutes as the most prevalent, reliable approach, and holds clear promise especially since the selective acyl transfer reactions have been well explored through activation of acyl donors by both small- $molecule^{19-23}$ and enzyme $catalysts^{24-26}.$ In the past, studies on macrolactonization mainly focused on developing new carboxylic acid/alcohol coupling reagents and methods to ensure the lactone formations, in which the stereochemical course is mostly controlled by the inherent pre-existing chirality of substrates. There are fewer studies on using catalysts to simultaneously govern the lactonization reaction and stereochemical controls. In 2020, Collins and co-workers showed that the reaction between di-carboxylic acids(tethered with aliphatic linkers) and ortho-substituted benzylic diols can be mediated by the Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) enzyme catalyst to form macrolactones (Fig. $1C)^{27}.$ Due to rotational constraints posed by the macrocycles, the macrolactone products feature planar chirality and are obtained with excellent enantioselectivities under the control of the CALB enzyme catalyst. Additionally, it is noteworthy that\nArticle\nplanar chiral macrolactones by enzyme catalysis; D Our proposed carbene organocatalytic strategy for planar enantioselective macrolactonization.\nchiral frameworks with planar stereogenicity are not only of high interest in their distinct molecular chirality, but also broadly present in natural products and utilized in asymmetric catalysis and materials(Fig. $1A)^{28-30}.$ Despite this elegant $work^{27},$ examples to address the longstanding challenge of catalytic approach toward planar chiral cyclo phane molecules remains largely $unexplored^{31-38}$\nWe are interested in exploring N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as a small-molecule catalyst to address synthetic challenges in complex $molecules^{39}.$ NHC is, in principle, a class of excellent acylation catalysts that can offer multiple handles to modulate reactivity and chemo/regio/stereo- $selectivities^{0-45}.$ In this work, we disclose a non-enzymatic organocatalytic strategy for efficient access to planar chiral macrolactones (Fig. 1D). The reaction of the NHC catalyst with aldehyde moiety of the bifunctional hydroxyl aldehyde substrate 1 under oxidative conditions effectively leads to an NHC-bound acyl azolium $intermediate^{46-49}.$ This intermediate then reacts with the alcohol moiety of the substrate to close the lactone ring. The pro-chiral arene planes from substrate 1 in the intermediate are well differentiated by stereo-control of the chiral NHC catalyst, leading to the planar chiral macrolactones 2 with good yields and excellent enantiomeric ratios. In the long round, our study shall open new avenues in accessing macrolactones with various chirality styles and ring structures by using readily available small-molecule catalysts.\nResults and discussion\nWe commenced our investigation with the expeditious preparation of acyclic substrate 1a (Fig. 2). Substituted naphthol aldehyde 4a was easily accessed through a reaction sequence involving a formylation and bromination process from commercially available 1-naphthol (3a). A side chain was subsequently installed with 5a via a Mitsunobu reaction, leading to the desired model substrate 1a through mild deprotection of the TBS group upon treatment with TBAF.\nWith the acyclic aldehyde 1a in hand, we set out to study the carbene-catalyzed enantioselective macrocyclization (Fig. 3). Gratifyingly, the reaction enabled by achiral NHC A with $K_{2}CO_{3}$ in toluene at $100 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ gave rise to the desired product 2a in 35$\\%$ yield, revealing the feasibility of NHC-catalyzed macrolactonization transformation. Various chiral carbene catalysts B-H were then carefully screened to\n2\nArticle\nFig. 2 | Synthetic protocol of substrate 1a.

Whereas indanol-based catalyst D afforded the product in modest enantioselectivity (entries 2-4), we were pleased to find that N-2,4,6-trichlorophenyl substituted NHC E was superior to give the product 2a in a promising 75:25 enantioselectivity(entry 5). Further introduction of substituents (e.g. Br and $NO_{2})$ on the indanol aromatic ring significantly improved the planar enantioselectivity, in which catalyst G furnished the product in 91:9 selectivity, albeit in a modest yield resulting from the competing intermolecular lactonization process to form the dimerization side product (see Supplementary Information for details) (entry 7). By evaluation of other catalysts, bases (entries 8-11) as well as various solvents and temperatures (see Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Information for details), we were delighted to achieve the stereoselective synthesis of planar chiral product 2a with 64$\\%$ yield and 93:7 er by employment of catalyst G with DABCO as the base (entry 11). Encouraged by the successful examples on cooperative NHC and co- $catalysts^{50-55},$ we then turned to examine various hydrogen bond donors (HBD), as well as Lewis acids/Bronsted acids to further enhance the catalytic performance (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Information for details). Satisfyingly, an optimal condition was obtained utilizing a cinchona-derived HBD-3 as a cocatalyst in the presence of a mixed solvent (toluene:n-heptane), furnishing the product 2a in 80$\\%$ isolated yield and 96:4 er (entry 15). The improved results might arise from the additional hydrogen-bonding interaction provided by the thiourea moiety of HBD-3 with the hydroxyl group and NHC-bound acyl azolium $intermediate^{31-36}.$ Furthermore, the use of enantiomeric NHC G (ent-G) as the carbene catalyst afforded the product 2a in 70$\\%$yield and a reversed 6:94 er (entry 16), indicating a slight match/mismatch relationship between NHC G and co-catalyst HBD-3. It is\n3\ntoluene/n-heptane (11:9 v/v,1 mM) under $N_{2}$ atmosphere at $100 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 12 h; Isolated\nyields; $^{b}$ Reactions at $70 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 12 h.\nalso worth noting that the cyclophane product 2a showed a remarkable configurational stability upon thermal racemization experiment of macrolactone 2a in mesitylene, in which erosion of enantioselectivity was not observed even at $150 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ when the title compound 2a started to decompose.\nWith the optimal reaction conditions established, we set out to study the generality of the carbene-catalyzed synthesis of planar chiral macrolactones (Fig.4).An array of substituents on the aromatic moiety of aldehyde substrate 1 were initially explored in the catalytic stereoselective macrocyclization. In addition to bromo group, substrates with chloro- and iodo-functional units were readily converted smoothly under the optimal conditions, delivering to the corresponding products 2b and 2c in 61-75$\\%$ yields with high enantioselectivities (95:5 and 97:3 er, respectively). Installment of a diverse set of aromatic substitutions on the naphthalene moiety of 1 was subsequently studied. To our delight, the 3-phenyl substituted substrate afforded the macrolactone 2d with 81$\\%$ yield and 93:7 er. Various substituents such as Cl, $CH_{3}, OCH_{3}$ at the para-position of 3-phenyl group showed excellent compatibility under this condition, providing products 2e-g with even higher yields (82-88$\\%$) and good stereoselectivities. Furthermore, the 3-aryl unit on the naphthalene core of 1 could be replaced with 2-naphthyl (2h) and various heteroaromatic units such as thienyl (2i), furyl (2j), benzothienyl (2k) and benzofuranyl(2I) substituents, which significantly expanded the scope of planar chiral macrolactone derivatives. Further modification of the 3-substituent to 2-position of the naphthalene scaffold with a simple methyl group furnished the product 2 m in 78$\\%$ yield and 95:5 er. Noteworthy is that [18]-paracyclophanes 2n and 2o with ortho-disubstituted phenyl ring could also be prepared with our method, wherein the $NO_{2}$ group was compatible under the catalytic conditions albeit in a slightly dropped enantioselectivity (20,90:10 er). Notably, these planar chiral products exhibit substantial configurational stability as well, as demonstrated by product 2o, which did not show decreased er value upon heating in mesitylene at $150 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ while the title compound 2o gradually decomposed.\nNext, we turned to examine the length of the ansa chain to prepare paracyclophanes with various ring sizes (Fig.5). Substrates with a 13-, or 12-membered ansa chain were readily converted to the corresponding planar chiral macrolactones 2p (with a 17-membered macrocycle) and 2q (with a 16-membered macrocycle) in excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, the absolute configuration of the planar chiral macrolactone products was established as $(R_{p})^{56}$ by analogy to product 2p via X-ray crystallographic analysis. However, further reducing the ansa chain to 11 members failed to give the corresponding product 2r under the optimal conditions, most likely due to the unfavorable formation of a rigidified macrocycle. On the other hand, the side chain could be readily extended to 15 and 16 members, which produced the products 2s and 2t in 93:7 and 86:14 er, respectively. Furthermore, various functionalized linkers in the ansa chain, such as thioether (2u), 1,3-diyne (2v) and ether (2w), were compatible to deliver the corresponding products 2u-w in modest yields and high enantioselectivities.\n4\nArticle\nThe optically enriched planar chiral macrolactones prepared in our approach could readily undergo further synthetic transformations(Fig. 6). A palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross coupling reaction between 2a and 6 afforded chiral cyclophane 7 with 80$\\%$ yield and 94:6 er. Other transition-metal-catalyzed couplings were also viable to diversify the catalytically obtained macrolactone products. For instance, a Heck reaction with styrene 8 enabled by Pd(OAc) $_{2}/ PPh_{3}$ afforded the alkenetethered planar chiral macrocycle 9 in 42$\\%$ yield and 95:5 er. Additionally, Sonogashira coupling of 2c with terminal alkyne 10 led to product 11 in 92$\\%$ yield and without erosion of er value.\nIn summary, we have developed a carbene organocatalytic approach for planar enantioselective macrolactonization. A wide range of cyclophanes, featuring intriguing configurationally stable planar stereogenicity owing to the restricted ring flip of the macrocycles, were obtained efficiently in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities under oxidative NHC conditions. Diversification of the chiral macrocycles were readily achieved through a series of coupling reactions to significantly expand the scope of this method. Furthermore, our approach provides a (non-enzymatic) organocatalytic approach to address the longstanding challenge in stereoselective preparation of planar chiral macrolactones. New avenues by carbene organocatalytic approach for synthetic implementation to access optically enriched planar chiral frameworks and biologically intriguing macrocyclic scaffolds could be anticipated. Ongoing studies in our laboratory include development of the prepared planar chiral macrolactones for chiral catalyst design, and biological activity evaluation for novel agrochemical discovery.\nMethods\nTo a 100.0 mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar was added chiral NHC pre-catalyst G(5.2mg,20mol$\\%$),DQ(30.6mg, 150mol$\\%$,),DABCO(1.12mg,20mol$\\%$),HBD-3(5.17mg,15mol$\\%$)and\nB(OH)2\n+52\n14\ntBu\n$\\frac{Pd(PPh_{3})_{4},Na_{2}CO_{3}}{100 ^\\circ\\text{C}}$\nBu\n/7\\\\80$\\%$,94:6 e.r.\n$(1)_{2}$\n14\n$\\begin{matrix}Ph^{n}\\\\ 8 \\end{matrix}$\n14\n0\nPd(OAc) $_{2}$ , $PPh_{3}$\n\"o\n$Et3N,100 ^\\circ\\text{C}$\n0\nVBr\nPh\n2a (Br) or 2c (l)\n42$\\%$,95:5 e.r.\nPh\n10\n14\nPd( $PPh_{3})_{2}Cl_{2}$ ,Cul\n0\n$Et3N,50 ^\\circ\\text{C}$\n0\n11\nPh\n92$\\%$,97:3 e.r.\naldehyde substrate 1 (0.05 mmol, 1.0 equiv.).

The synthetic method uses an NHC catalyst to form an acylazolium intermediate with the aldehyde portion of a hydroxyl aldehyde substrate under oxidative conditions, and then the intermediate reacts with the hydroxyl portion of the substrate to form a lactone ring.This led to faceted chiral macrolide products with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity through chiral NHC catalysts as well as under stereocontrol of thiourea co-catalysts. An organo-N-heterocyclic carbene-catalysed method for the efficient construction of facially chiral macrolide compounds was developed. The method addresses the long-standing challenges of chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity in macrolide esterification reactions. At the same time, a series of coupling reactions enables diverse derivatisation of chiral macrocycles, thus significantly expanding the applicability of the method."}

In this work, we report a family of chiral N-heterocyclic carbene(NHC)-ligated boryl radicals as catalysts that enable catalytic asymmetric radical cyclisomerization reactions. The radical catalysts can be generated from easily prepared NHC-borane complexes, and the broad availability of the chiral NHC component provides substantial benefits for stereochemical control. Mechanistic studies support a catalytic cycle comprising a sequence of boryl radical addition, hydrogen atom transfer, cyclization, and elimination of the boryl radical catalyst, wherein the chiral NHC subunit determines the enantioselectivity of the radical cyclization. This catalysis allows asymmetric construction of valuable chiral heterocyclic products from simple starting materials.\nilar enantioselective catalytic reaction usi peptide-based thiyl radical (40). Despite tl exciting findings, the inherent reactivity of these radical catalysss limits their applicability to other types of catalytic reactions. Moreover, the types of competent chiral components are limited, and the preparation of the chiral precatalysts usually requires a lengthy series of steps, thereby hindering their applications. To achieve a conceptually distinct and generally applicable asymmetric radical catalysis, there is a compelling need to find a group of element radical catalysts that not only display specific chemical reactivity to enable mechanistically distinct catalytic cycles but can also be readily connected with a chiral unit that is widely available and easily allows structural diversification.\nN-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-boryl radicals, a class of boron-centered radicals ligated with an NHC component, have shown specific chemical reactivity and have recently found application in chemical synthesis (4I, 4.2) since the pioneering work by the groups of Fensterbank, Lac $\\widehat{\\widehat{t}e},$ Malacria, and Curran (43). These radicals can be easily generated from readily available NHC- $BH_{3}$ complexes through hydrogen atom abstraction with the aid of a radical initiator (43). The Walton, Lacote, and Curran groups (44) and our group (45,46) discovered that the addition of NHC-boryl radicals to alkenes was a reversible process, which suggests that these radicals may be used as competent catalysts in radical addition-elimination processes. On this basis, we reported an NHC-boryl radical-catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of N-(2ethynylaryl)arylamides (32). Encouraged by this finding, we perceived that the use of a chiral NHC-ligated boryl radical as the catalyst would be able to achieve extraordinary enantioselective catalytic radical reactions (Fig. 1B, right). It is known that a wide variety of chiral NHC precursors are either commercially available or can be prepared easily, and a simple treatment with $BH_{3}\\cdot$ THF in the presence of a base can provide a vast array of bench-stable chiral NHC- $BH_{3}$ complexes (43). This advantage makes it easy to obtain a large library of NHCboryl radicals tethered with various structurally tunable chiral components, which is highly vaiuable for reaction screening and development.\nIn this work, we report the development of a general and efficient mode of asymmetric NHC-boryl radical cattalysis, which enables asymmetric radical cycloisomerization reactions for the rapid assembly of a range of enantioenriched five- and six-membered heterocycles(Fig. 1C). The catalytic cycle proceeds through a sequence of boryl radical addition to alkynes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), cyclization, and elimination of the boryl radical catalyst, during which the chiral NHC unit creates a chiral microenvironment that can exert effective stereochemical control in the C-C bond-forming\nhe design and discovery of enantioselective catalysts has been a persistent goal of organic chemistry, given the increasing demands for enantiomerically pure chiral products as pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Over the past decades, great progress has been achieved in the development of cattalytic enantioselective reactions involving radical species as key intermediates(I-4), in which a variety of elegant catalytic approaches-including the use of Lewis acids(5-7), organocatalysts (8,9), transition metals(10-I4), enzyme catalysts (I5, 16), and photocatalysts (17-20)-have been reported. Despite these exciting advances, the exploitation of structurally and functionally distinct chiral catalysts and mechanistically distinct catalytic reactions is highly desirable and yet challenging to accomplish.\nFree organic radicals are commonly involved as stoichiometric promoters or intermediates in a variety of reactions (2I). By contrast, the use of free organic radicals as the catalysts remains limited (22) because the short lifetime and the high reactivity of these species pose a marked challenge in the realization of efficient catalytic cycles. However, their specific chemical properties can promote notable molecular transformations that are not easily accessible by other known catalytic methods. In this regard, a set of radical species, including thiyl radicals (23-25), stannyl radicals (26,27), nitrogen radicals (28, 29), bromine radicals(30,31), and boron-centered radicals (32-34), have been reported as effective catalysts for cyclization reactions. Nevertheless, asymmetric reactions using chiral radical catalysts remain a daunting challenge (35-37). In this context, as depicted in Fig. IA, the radical catalyst undergoes addition to a prochiral substrate to form a covalent bond, and the resulting radical intermediate participates in enantioselective radical transformations, wherein the bound chiral unit determines the enantioselectivity. Eventually, an elimination reaction occurs to break the formed covalent bond, furnishing a chiral product and regenerating the radical catalyst. The major difficulty for such asymmetric radical catalysis lies in the lack of competent chiral catalysts, on which the chiral unit should be broadly available and easy to install and, more importantly, should cooperate with the radical center to achieve both high catalytic efficiency and enantioselectivity.\nAccordingly, only a very limited number of chiral radical catalysts and associated enantioselective reactions have thus far been reported(Fig. 1B, left). For example, the Zhang group reported a series of cobalt-based metalloradical catalysts in which the chiral porphyrin ligands played a dual role in controlling both the reactivity and the stereoselectivity (35). These cobalt catalysts were specifically effective in activating diazo and azide compounds and then triggering enantioselective catalytic radical transformations (38,39). In 2014, the Maruoka group designed an organic thiyl radical that could catalyze an enantioselective cycloaddition of vinylcyclopropanes and alkenes (36), wherein strain-promoted ring opening served as an important driving force to favor the thiyl radical addition (23,24). Very recently, Miller and colleagues reported a sim-\n1 of 9\nMe\nN=\n。\nF\nH\nH2N\nMe\n0=\nO\nN\nF\nHO\naticaprant\nlarotrectinib\n2 of 9\ncyclization step. The reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity have been elucidated by experimental and computational studies. The obtained heterocycles containing an $\\alpha -$ stereocenter resemble chiral fragments of pharmaceuticals or targeted compounds in medicinal chemistry studies (Fig. 1D)(47-49), but their enantioselective synthesis by asymmetric catalysis from simple starting materials remains a challenge.\nReaction design\nDuring the course of our study on NHC-boryl radical-triggered cascade cyclization reactions(4I), we hypothesized that if a cascade could generate a $\\beta -$ boryl alkyl radical intermediate. $\\beta -$ elimination would take place to liberate the boryl radical, thereby completing a radical catalytic cycle. Furthermore, our previous work had revealed that the regioselectivity of the boryl radical addition to alkynes was tunable by varying the alkynyl substituents (45,50). This feature would allow divergent catalytic cycles that might yield a diverse family of cyclic molecules. On the basis of these considerations, we posited two boryl radical-catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions that proceed through distinct cycles (Fig. 1C). In cycle A, an NHC-boryl radical attacks $C_{a}$ of 1 when $R^{1}$ has more radical stabilizing capacity, giving vinyl radical I. After that, a 1,6-hydrogen atom shift occurs to give alkyl radical II, which then undergoes 5-exo cyclization to afford radical III with the construction of the five-membered ring skeleton(51,52). The chiral unit on the boron biases the trajectory of the radical approaching the boronsubstituted alkenyl carbon atom, thus realizing enantiocontrol. Finally, the NHC-boryl radical catalyst is eliminated from III to complete the catalytic cycle with the formation of product 2. When an aryl ring is attached at $C_{a},$ the NHCboryl radical catalyst undergoes addition to $C_{b}$ of 3 instead (50), and the subsequent 1,5-H shift-cydization-elimination sequence completes the catalytic cycle, furnishing product 4. Again, the enantioseleciivity is determined by the chiral NHC component during the cyclization step.\nReaction development\nTo verify the feasibility of our proposed two catalytic cycles, la and 3a were chosen as the model substrates for reaction development.First, the catalytic reactions were proven effective using a simple achiral NHC- $BH_{3}(L,3-$ dimethylimidazol2-ylidene borane) as the precatalyst, affording 3-methylenepyrrolidine 2a and pyrrolo[3,2,1ij]quinoline 4a in 96$\\%$ and 85$\\%$ yields,respectively (table S1, entry 1, and table S2, entry 1). Control experiments showed that no reaction occurred in the absence of a radical initiator(table SI, entry 2, and table S2, entry 2), which confirms the radical reaction mechanism of both transformations. Encouraged by this finding, we next investigated enantioselective boryl radical-catalyzed transformations using chiral NHC- $BH_{3}$ as the precatalyst (Fig. 2). Extensive screening revealed that the reaction of 1a with B-1 (20 mol $\\%$) provided 2a in 83$\\%$ yield with high levels of both asymmetric induction[96:4 enantiomeric ratio (er)] and E/Z selectivity (>95:5). Reducing the catalyst loading to 10 mol $\\%$ resulted in a drop of product yield to 46$\\%$ with the recovery of 45$\\%$ yield of la, mainly because of the short lifetime and high reactivity of this boryl radical species that may cause its fast consumption through other pathways. Changing the t-Bu group in B-1 to a Bn(B-2, 73:27 er) or i-Pr (B-9,59.5:40.5 er; fig. S1) led to a marked decrease in enantioselectivity, which indicates an important steric shielding effect of this t-Bu group in the enantioselective cyclization step. Other types of chiral NHC- $BH_{3}$ complexes (B-3 to B-8) gave inferior yields and stereoselectivities. For the reaction of 3a, B-5\n3 of 9\nFig. 3.

The replacement of the N-aryl group with a t-Bu could maintain good er (B-6, 89.5:10.5) while a drop of product yield was resulted. The reactions with other types of chiral NHC skeletons (B-1 to B-4 and B-7 to B-8) were found to be much less effective. Notably, gram-scale syntheses of 2a and 4a were also achieved in good yields while maintaining excellent enantioselectivities. The use of ent-B-1 and ent-B-5 as the catalysts reversed the stereochemistry, giving 2a and 4a in 4.5:95.5 er and 7:93 er, respectively (figs. S1 and S2).

Using B-1 as the precatalyst and azobiscyclohexanecarbonitrile (ACCN) as the radical initiator, a broad range of N-homopropargyl amines 1 were stereoselectively converted to the corresponding 2-aryl-3-benzylidenepyrrolidines 2 (Fig. 3). The reaction worked well when the $R^{1}$ substituent was an aryl ring. Aryl rings bear ing an electron-withdrawing group (2a to 2c) generally provided higher product yields compared with a ring substituted with an electrondonating group (2e), likely because the electron deficiency promotes nucleophilic boryl radical addition. Changing the aryl group to an ester(If) or an amide (lg) moiety was also compatible with the cycloisomerization, furnishing the corresponding products 2f and 2g in good yields and excellent er, although a lower E/Z selectivity was obtained. An aryl ring as the $R^{2}$ substituent was found to be important to trigger the catalytic cycle because aryl stabilization is the main factor enabling intramolecular HAT and the subsequent cyclization step. A broad array of (hetero)aryl rings, including naphthalene (2j), carbazole (2k), indole(21), benzofuran (2m), pyridine (2n), thiophene(2o), and furan (2p), could be installed successfully in synthetically useful yields and excelent er. No detrimental effect was detected when other functional groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl(2q),benzoyl (2r), and 5-hydroxymethyl2-furoyl(2s), were incorporated at the nitrogen atom. The absolute configuration of 2r was confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analysis. Furthermore, the present catalytic method allowed for the construction of a 3-benzylidenetetrahydrofuran framework (2t and 2u), albeit with a slight decrease of er. In place of an aryl group, a tert-butoxycarbonyl (2v and 2w) and N,Ndimethylaminocarbonyl (2x) could be used as substituent $R^{2},$ affording the corresponding pyrrolidines in moderate to good yields and er. Compound 2v was obtained using ent-B1 as the catalyst.\nThe catalytic cycloisomerization of 1-benzyl7-alkynyl-indoles 3 proceeded smoothly with 20 mol $\\%$ of B-5 in the presence of 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethyl)valeronitrile (ABVN) as the radical initiator, affording a broad range of pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolines 4 in good yields and enantioselectivities (Fig. 4). An aryl group as $R^{4}$ was again important to enable intramolecular HAT. A series of substituents at different positions on the aryl ring (4b to 4f) were compatible, and a thiophene moiety could be installed as well(4g). A wide variety of substituted indoles $(R^{5}$ and $R^{6})$ underwent this catalytic transformation stereoselectively to afford the corresponding products in good yields. For example, a large number of 2-alkyl (4h and 4i),2-cycloalkyl (4j and 4k), 2-allyl(4l), and 2-aryl(4m to 4o) substituted pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolines were successfully assembled with high yields and good er. The absolute configuration of 4o was also established by x-ray crystallography. Other types of tetracyclic products 4p and 4q were formed in good yields without any loss of enantioselectivity. Carbazole 3r was also a viable substrate, delivering the desired product 4r in 88$\\%$ yield with 87.5:12.5 er. When the $R^{5}$ substituent on the indole ring was a hydrogen atom, the reaction afforded product 4s in good yield and er. Further studies on the effect of the $R^{3}$ group revealed that a methoxycarbonyl group was crucial to enable efficient boryl radical addition, and the change to an electron-deficient aryl group (4t) or a $CF_{3}$ group (4u) led to no formation of the product. We speculated that, in these cases, the boryl radical addition to the internal alkyne moiety might take place with much lower regioselectivity, resulting in rapid consumption of the boryl radical catalyst. As a result, no cycloisomerization product was detected.\nSynthetic applications and a catalytic\nintermolecular reaction\nTo illustrate the synthetic utilities of these two catalytic cycloisomerizations, the two obtained types of cyclic products were readily converted to a variety of versatile building blocks (Fig.5). For example, hydroboration of the alkene motif of 2a with $BH_{3}$ ``THF followed by deboration or oxidation led to hydrogenation product 5 or alcohol 6, respectively, in good yields with the maintenance of excellent enantioselectivity, and only single diastereomers were detected in both reactions. The absolute configuration of 6 was ascertained by x-ray crystallography. Notably, a simple treatment of alcohol 6 with $CF_{3}SO_{3}H$ triggered a stereoselective intramolec ular cydization to produce fused cyclic product 7 in 87$\\%$ yield with >95:5 diastereomeric ratio(dr). Moreover, the reaction of 2r with bromine and the subsequent base-promoted elimination afforded alkenyl bromide 8 in 74$\\%$ yield with 94.5:5.5 er. This bromide would serve as a versatile precursor to couple with a wide variety of functional groups with the aid of transition metal catalysis. In addition, the ester moiety of product 4a was easily reduced to alcohol 9 in good yield. Hydrogenation of the alkene moiety afforded a quinoline framework 10, which is a core motif of many biologically active molecules (48). Subjection of 4a to our previously developed radical hydroboration protocol using 1,3-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene borane as the boryl radical precursor (53) formed a-borylated ester 11 in good yield with exclusive regio- and stereoselectivity; absolute configuration was again confirmed by x-ray crystallography. This compound could be transformed to 1,2-diol 12 through the reduction of the ester unit followed by the oxidation of the boron moiety. Notably, alkyl pinacol boronic ester 13 was obtained when the resulting reduction intermediate was treated with pinacol in the presence of HCl. A plausible reaction mechanism for this unexpected transformation is discussed in the supplementary materials (fig. S3). The boron moiety of compound 13 could serve as a versatile handle to access a large number of functionalized quinoline derivatives, which could be of interest in medicinal chemistry studies (48). The stereochemistry was largely retained in all these transformations.\nThis asymmetric radical catalysis protocol also provides highly efficient methods for the synthesis of key intermediates toward cyclothialidine and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist Ro 67-8867 (Fig. 5C). For example, ozonolysis of 2v followed by reduction with $NaBH_{4}$ afforded compound 14, which is an important intermediate for cyclothialidine(49), in 81$\\%$ yield as a single diastereomer while maintaining good enantioselectivity. Hydrogenation of the alkene motif of 2w and the subsequent reduction with $LiAIH_{4}$ gave compound 15, which underwent ring expansion and hydrogenolysis to deliver 3-hydroxy-piperidine 16 with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. An alkylation reaction of 16 following the known procedure could produce Ro 678867(54).\nThe asymmetric NHC-boryl radical catalysis was also applicable for an enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cyclization reaction(55). As depicted in Fig. 5D, the catalytic cycle was initiated from the addition of the boryl radical catalyst to the triple bond of propiolate 17, and the resulting alkenyl radical added to one equivalent of alkene 18 to give a new alkyl radical. The addition to a second molecule of alkene 18 followed by intramolecular cyclization constructed a cyclohexane ring. Eventually, a $\\beta -$ elimination took place to afford product 19 with the regeneration of the boryl radical catalyst. Although moderate yield and enantioselectivity of product 19 were obtained (fig. S4 and table S3), this exemplified catalysis suggests a catalytic radical [2+2+2] method to assemble chiral six-membered rings.\nMechanistic considerations\nBecause chiral NHC- $BH_{3}$ complexes have the potential to act as HAT catalysts (56,57)namely, the boryl radical abstracts one of the benzylic hydrogen atoms and eventually retums a hydrogen atom to the alkenyl radical generated after the intramolecular cydizationthe catalytic reactions of $1a-D_{2}$ and $3d-D_{2}$ , which both contain two benzylic deuterium atoms, were examined.

These results excluded a HAT catalysis pathway. This method would be of great value in the synthesis of enantioenriched D-incorporated analogs that may be of interest in medicinal chemistry studies. Furthermore, monodeuterated la $-D_{1}$ and $3d-D_{1}$ were prepared as substrates for the study of intramolecular kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) of the two catalytic reactions using the corresponding chiral precatalysts (figs.S7 and S8). The intramolecular KIE values were determined to be 5.3 and 3.5 for $1a-D_{1}$ and $3d-D_{1},$ respectively, which are in good agreement with the proposed step of C-H bond cleavage through intramolecular HAT. Moreover, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping experiments (58) verified the generation of NHC-boryl radicals from B-1 and B-5 under the in situ reaction conditions (figs. S9 and S10).\nNext, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to gain more insight into the reaction mechanism and the origins of enantioselectivity. The energy profile of the reaction of la is depicted in Fig. 6 (details are provided in the supplementary materials). The NHC-boryl radical derived from B-1 is predicted to add to the alkynyl $C_{a}$ of la with an activation free energy of 9.0 kcal/mol to give aryl-stabilized alkenyl radical Int-I. The subsequent 1,6-H shift proceeds through TS-II with an energy barrier of 14.1 kcal/mol. From Int-II, the cyclization may occur to produce two sets of diastereoisomeric intermediates, among which trans (Int-IIII-trans-R and Int-III-trans-S) diastereomers form with lower activation energies compared with their cis counterparts, most likely because of the lower steric repulsion between the boron unit and the $Ar^{1}$ group.Careful inspection of the structures of two trans cyclization transition states elucidates the origins of enantio-induction by the bulky t-Bu on the oxazole ring. The enantioisomeric transition state TS-III-trans-R is favored over TS--IIItrans-S by 3.7kcal/mol, which is correlated well with the observed excellent enantioselectivity(96:4 er). The major reason for the differentiation is the highlighted steric hindrance between one of the t-Bu hydrogen atoms and the allylic hydrogen atom of the substrate. This is\ns of 9\nconsistent with experimental findings that the change of this t-Bu group to i-Pr or Bn leads to a precipitous drop of er. Eventually, the NHCboryl radical elimination takes place stereoselectively via TS-IV-E to give the E isomer. The transition state TS-IV-Z to form the Z isomer has more steric congestion between the two aryl rings ( $Ar^{1}$ and $Ar^{2}),$ thus resulting in an elevated free activation energy $(\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\mp}=$ 2.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, only 2a with E geometry is obtained as a single stereoisomer.\nThe energy profile of the reaction of 3o (fig. S11) and its detailed discussion are provided in the supplementary materials. The results suggest that the enantioselectivity is determined in the 6-endo-trig cyclization step. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) and atoms-in-molecules(AIM) analysis performed with Multiwfn (59) showed that the presence of attractive noncovalent interactions in TS-III-RS-3o (fig. S11), including the $\\pi - \\pi$ stacking between the triazole ring and the indole moiety; CH $/ \\pi$ attractions between both $H_{a}$ and $H_{b}$ on the NHC part and the indole moiety; and the $\\pi - \\pi$ interaction between the ester group and the phenyl moiety make it more favorable over TS-III-SR-3o by 1.8 kcal/mol, which is correlated well with the enantioselectivity observed in the experiment. We anticipate that the broad accessibility and specific chemical reactivity of chiral NHC-boryl radicals will enable additional powerful catalytic enantioselective radical transformations with wide applicability.\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n1.S.Mondal et al.Chem.Rev.122,5842-5976(2022).\n2.X.-Y.

Utilizing the principle of reversible addition to unsaturated hydrocarbons, they have developed a new type of asymmetric cycloisomerization reaction with a completely novel reaction mechanism and catalytic cycle. These chiral boron radical precursors are simple to prepare, structurally diverse, and easy to modify, providing a basis for chiral control in reactions. Additionally, the team elucidated the catalytic reaction mechanism and the origins of stereoselectivity through quantum chemical calculations, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and deuterium labeling experiments. This precise control over the catalytic process lays the theoretical foundation for the precise design of catalysts based on artificial intelligence in the future. This work not only showcases the powerful capabilities of boron radical catalysis in asymmetric synthesis for the first time but also inspires and promotes the development of other main-group element radical catalysts and their asymmetric catalytic reactions, offering a new design approach and catalytic paradigm for the synthesis of chiral functional molecules."}

The synthetic reactivity of 2-hydroxyl-3peroxide indoline species was demonstrated by a unique multi-step bond cleavage and formation cascade. Using a readily available copper catalyst under open-air conditions, highly important yet synthetically difficult spiro[pyrrolidone-(3,1-benzoxazine)] products were obtained in a single operation. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of the natural products donaxanine and chimonamidine, as well as the 3-hydroxyl-pyrroloindoline scaffold, in just one or two steps.\n$T_{\\text{he donaxanine and donaxarine, which contain a common}}$ spiro[pyrrolidone-(3,1-benzoxazine)] tricyclic core, were isolated from Anmdo donax in 1995 by Abdullaev et al. $^{[1]}$ These skeletons have since been used frequently as lead structures for molecular design and drug screening but themselves have never been synthesized. $^{[2]}$ Moreover, the donaxanine skeleton was proposed as the biosynthetic precursor of natural product chimonamidine, $^{[1b]}$ and which could be further transformed to the important 3-hydroxyl-pyrroloindoline scaffold (Scheme $1).^{[3]}$ Recently, many synthetic routes and strategies have been developed for the synthesis of chimonamidine and 3-OH-pyrroloindolines from indole\nderivatives (such as: tryptamines) $.^{[4]}$ Encouraged by these researches, it is with great curiosity that the unique pyrrolidone spirocyclized 3,1-benzoxazine (donaxanine) scaffold could be synthesized directly from indole derived compounds. The main challenges encountered in this hypothesis include: 1) the skeletal editing of indole by oxygen atom insertion to form the basic 3,1-benzoxazine framework; 2) the introduction of the pyrrolidone moiety into the 4-position of 3,1-benzoxazine to form the quaternary spiro-carbon center while maintaining the integrity of the acid/base-sensitive oxazinane ring. $^{[5]}$\nThe oxygenation-initiated skeletal rearrangement/isomerization of tetrahydrocarboline derivatives (THCs) and tetrahydro $- \\beta -$ carboline derivatives (TH $\\beta$ Cs) presents an attractive strategy for the rapid assembly of structurally unique heterocycles, and some interesting synthetic routes have been identified. The two-electron oxidative rearrangement of TH $\\beta$ Cs to spirooxindoles, as a typical $H_{2}O-$ enabled reaction, has been frequently used and intensively investigated since the 1960s (Scheme $2a).^{[6]}$ Recently, by way of the singlet oxygen ene reaction, dye-sensitized photooxygenation has been creatively applied in the skeletal transformation of THCs and TH $\\beta$ Cs, in which the corresponding benzylic hydroperoxide is generated and instantly undergoes C-C bond cleavage to form the 2-acyl anilide intermediate(Scheme 2b). In the case of TH $\\beta$ Cs, Chen et al. $^{[7]}$ employed the so-produced 2-acyl anilides in acid-mediated cyclocondensations with anilines to furnish pyrrolo[3,4b]quinolin-9-amines (Scheme 2b, eq. 1). Since then, Brasholz et al. $^{[8]}$ realized an elegant direct construction of perhydropyrido[1,2-a]indoles from THCs in alkaline medium (Scheme 2b, eq. 2). However, these transformations can only be initiated from $H_{2}O$ or singlet oxygen $(^{1}O_{2})$ , respectively, and the research for new reaction modes and product diversification is still highly significant.\nNR $\\frac{2eoxidation}{H_{2}O}| \\space \\xrightarrow{\\text{semipinacol}}\\}$\nNR\nover 60 years history\nb) Previous works:1O2 induced\ntion of THCs\nX=NPg\\\\Ar- $NH_{2,H^{+}}$\nHN-A\nNPg 1) Chen et al.2017[7]\nsens .\nx= $CH_{2}\\\\ B^{-}1O_{2}$\n00\n2)Brasholz et al. $2020^{[8]}$\nc Copper-cattalzed oxygenaation rearrangementissomerzation of T\n$\\xrightarrow{Me}\\xrightarrow{Me}$\n$\\frac{LCu(I)=12/10mol $\\%$}{H_{2}O,airO_{2})}$\n22\ndonaxaniee\nHOH\neasly avallable copper catalyst\nnovel reaction pathway and t\nboth $H_{2}$ Oandari $(O_{2}$ as oxygen sources\noperaational simpliin air\nIn recent years, catalytic single-electron oxidation of indoles has emerged as an effective strategy for indole-based substrate transformations. $^{[9-10]}$ However, the development of such methods toward the functionalization of TH $\\beta$ Cs had been less-explored. $^{[11]}$ Based on the consensus mechanisms of the single-electron oxidation of indoles, which involve one-electron transfer to form the 3-radical iminium cation $intermediate^{[9-10]}$ that contains both electrophilic (C-2) and radical (C-3) reactive sites (Scheme 2c, int. A), we hypothesized that it might be possible to generate the 2-hydroxyl-3peroxide indoline species in situ via a catalytic singleelectron transfer (SET) process using $H_{2}O$ and $O_{2}$ as oxygen sources (Scheme 2c, int. B). We hoped that, by taking advantage of the adjacent highly reactive peroxide and hydroxyl moieties in one molecule, this strategy might provide new synthetic insights and novel reaction modes for the transformation of TH $\\beta$ Cs.\nHerein, we report the development of this oxygenation rearrangement reaction of TH $\\beta$ Cs, which is enabled by copper catalysis, providing direct access to the skeleton of donaxanine alkaloids.\nWe commenced our studies by optimizing the reaction conditions using N-Bn-substituted tetrahydro $- \\beta -$ carboline(TH $\\beta C)\\space 1a$ as the model substrate (Table 1). When only 10mol$\\%$ of the metal salt $CuBr_{2}$ was used as the catalyst in toluene ( $PhCH_{3})$ under air, only a trace amount of the desired skeletal rearrangement product 2a (CCDC $2294682)^{[12]}$ was detected (Table 1, entry 1). Considering that nitrogen-containing ligands showed the most influence on reaction efficiency in our previous relevant indole-oxidation researches, $^{[10]}$ we then turned our attention to ligand optimization. When bisbenzoxazoline L1 was used as the ligand, the desired product 2 a was obtained in 35 $\\%$ yield\n$\\frac{\\text{LMetalsalts}}{Solent,50 ^\\circ\\text{C} \\\\ H_{2}O,arh(O_{2})}$\n220\nXayof2a\\\\CCDC:2294682\n11\nL3\nL2\nL4:R=F\\\\L5:R=OMe\\\\L6:R=t-Bu\n[a] reaction carried out under air atmosphere: metal salt (0.02 mmol), other co-metal salt (0.02 mmol), L(0.024 mmol), PhCH3 (2.0 mL), $H_{2}O(8$ mmol), la (0.20 mmol) $, \\space 50^{\\circ}C. \\space [b]$ Yields are isolated yields. $[c] \\space 60 ^\\circ\\text{C} .[d] PhCH_{3}(1.0$ mL) and $CH_{3}$ CN(1.0 mL) used as solvent.[e] PhCH3 (2.0 mL) and CH3CN (1.0 mL) used as solvent.\n(entry 2). Inspired by this result, structural modification of the bisbenzoxazoline ligand was investigated. The bisbenzothiazoline L2 and 2-(pyridin-2-yl)benzoxazole L3 failed to effectively improve the yield (entries 3-4). When the -F and-OMe group were introduced to the bisbenzoxazoline skeleton, the ligands L4 and L5 still did not promote the reaction (entries 5 and 6). Interestingly, when di-tert-butylsubstituted bisbenzoxazoline L6/ $CuBr_{2}$ was used as the catalyst, the desired product 2 a was isolated in 46 $\\%$ yield(entry 7). Attempts to enhance the yield with other copper salts were unsuccessful (entries 8-11). The product yield was increased to 50 $\\%$ when the reaction was conducted at $60 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ (entry 12). Gratifyingly, under dual-copper catalysis with $CuBr_{2}/$ CuOAc, the yield of the desired product was further improved to 56 $\\%$ (entry 13). The reaction solvent was also explored, revealing that the mixed-solvent system $PhCH_{3}/$ $CH_{3}$ CN was key to the reaction efficiency, and the yield of the desired product 2 a was successfully improved to 77 $\\%$when $PhCH_{3}/CH_{3}$ CN (2:1,v/v) was used.\nWith the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we then investigated the substrate scope of the reaction. As shown in Scheme 3, a wide range of $N_{\\beta}-$ benzyl TCHs bearing electronically different substituents on the benzyl ring reacted smoothly to give the desired rearrangement products in 51 $\\%$-77 $\\%$ yields.

The structure of 2c (CCDC $2252376)^{[13]}$ was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The N-furan-2-yl methyl-, N-thiophen-2-yl methyl-, and N-benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl methyl-substituted TH $\\beta$ Cs tolerated the optimal conditions, giving the corresponding products 2i-2k in 37$\\%$-61$\\%$yields. Cinnamyl-substituted TH $\\beta$ Cs were also found to be suitable substrates, affording the desired products 2l-2 m in moderate to good yields. Furthermore, the use of different allyl-substituted carboline substrates afforded the corresponding products 2 n-2 o in 49 $\\%$-59 $\\%$ yields. It is notable that substrates bearing simple N-alkyl groups, such as but-3en-1-yl (2p), cyclopentane (2q), cyclohexane (2r), and tetrahydro-2H-pyran (2s), undergo the reaction smoothly, affording the desired rearrangement products 2 p-2s in moderate yields.\nMoreover, reactions of diverse N-benzyl TH $\\beta$ Cs containing both electron-rich or electron-poor groups at different positions of the indole benzene ring, such as methyl (2t,2x, and 2aa), methoxy (2 v), fluoro (2 u), chloro (2 w, 2y), and bromo (2z,2ab), reacted smoothly under the optimal conditions, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. The $\\gamma -$ ester-substituted TH $\\beta C$ was also tolerated, giving the desired product 2ac in 41 $\\%$ yield with 1.6/1 dr. Furthermore, the scalability of this catalytic method was validated by 1.0-mmol-scale syntheses of 2 a, resulting in considerable yields.\nEncouraged by the retrosynthetic analysis, the utility of this catalytic method was explored by the concise total synthesis of the natural products donaxarine and chimonamidine, as well as the synthetically important 3-hydroxylpyrroloindoline scaffold (Scheme 4). Under the optimal reaction conditions, the one-step synthesis of donaxarine 3 was realized from commercially available N-Me TH $\\beta C \\space 1ad$ in 32 $\\%$ yield. On the basis of the successful oxidation of 1 ad under the established conditions, the natural product chimonamidine 4 was also synthesized followed by a simple\nMe\nHO\nL6CuBr2/Bi(OH)3\n1)DIBAL.H(3eq.)\nV-Me\n46$\\%$\n\\begin{matrix} H = B n \\\\ 1 a : R = B n \\\\ 1 a d : R = M e \\end{matrix}\n32$\\%$\\\\R=Me\ndonaxanie(3)\nNHC NHC\nR=Bn|stand.cond,\nOH\n28-80\nX-ray of 5(CCDC:2252388\none-step reduction process by the use of 3 equivalent of diisobutylalumium hydride (DIBAL-H) reagent. As privileged structures, the 3-hydroxyl-pyrroloindolines are widely encountered in natural products and frequently used as organic synthons in the synthesis of alkaloids, $^{[4]}$ and these can also be directly prepared from TH $\\beta$ Cs using this reaction as a key step. For example, the methyl- and benzylsubstituted 3-hydroxyl-pyrroloindoline 5 was successfully synthesized from the oxidative product 2a via a reduction step with 15 equivalent of DIBAL-H in 51 $\\%$ yield, and its structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography (CCDC $2252388).^{[14]}$ These transformations show that the current method is potentially useful in diversity-oriented synthesis, and they provide new insight into skeletal evolution of the spiro[pyrrolidone-(3,1-benzoxazine)] scaffold.\nTo gain insight into the mechanism of the reaction, several control experiments were conducted (Scheme 5). When $H_{2}^{18}O$ was used instead of $H_{2}O,$ the heavy-oxygenlabeled product $[^{18}O]-2$ awas identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis (Scheme 5,eq.1). Furthermore, the double-heavy-oxygen-labeled product $[2^{18}O]-2$ awas identified upon the combined addition of $H_{2}^{18}O and^{18}O_{2}$ (Scheme 5, eq. 2). These results indicated that the two oxygen atoms in products 2 a mainly come from $H_{2}O$ and $O_{2},$ respectively. Furthermore, the product $[^{18}O]-2$ aprepared $under^{18}O_{2}$ conditions was further transformed to give the ring opening dehydration $[^{18}O]-$ labeled product 6 (Scheme 5, eq. 3). These results suggest that the oxygen of carbonyl group in product 2a mainly comes from $O_{2}.$ When the a-di-deuterated substrate $[D_{2}]-1a$ was employed under the standard conditions, the 2-position dideuterated product $[D_{2}]-2$ awas confirmed $by^{1}H$ NMR analysis (Scheme 5, eq. 4). Furthermore, when the $\\alpha -^{13}C-$ labeled substrate $[^{13}C]-1$ awas used, the $2-^{13}C-$ labeled product $[^{13}C]-2$ awas isolated and identified (Scheme 5. eq. 5). In the presence of $D_{2}O$ or deuterated solvent\n(2)\nBn\nHad Had $H_{2}O$\n[18O]-2a\n$\\frac{stand \\space . \\space cond \\space .}{H_{2}^{16}0.18O_{2}}$\n$[2^{18}O]-2a$\nconfimed by HRMS\n200\n$\\overset{DIBAL-H}{\\xrightarrow{51 $\\%$}}$ \\space 18 \\space $\\overset{|PPh_{3},CCl_{4}}{57 $\\%$}$ \\space (3) \\space $[^{18}O]-2a$ \\space confimed by HRMS \\space NH-Me \\space $\\overset{\\text{standard conditions}}{52 $\\%$}$ \\space (4) \\space [D2]-1a \\space [D2]-2a \\space \\xrightarrow {\\text{standard conditions}} \\space 61$\\%$ \\space (5) \\space $[^{13}C]-1a$ \\space $[^{13}C]-2a$ \\space ( $CD_{3}$ CN, $PhCD_{3}),$ no C-H deuteration product was obtained under the optimized conditions (see Supporting Information 3.2 for details). These results suggest that the hydrogen-transfer process can be largely ruled out, and that an intramolecular formal - $CH_{2}-$ group migration process is involved in the reaction.\nIn addition, to the formation of desired product 2a, a 9 $\\%$ yield of N-methylene dimer 9 and a trace amount of imino alcohol 7 and pyrrolidone derivative 8 were observed under the standard conditions (Scheme 6, eq. 1). When the imino alcohol 7 was conducted under the standard conditions, only trace amount of product 2a was observed. However, the product 2a could be obtained smoothly when 1 equivalent of external $H_{2}O_{2}$ was used (Scheme 6, eqs. 2-3). These results suggested that the compound 7 and $H_{2}O_{2}$ might be generated in situ and acted as key roles for the formation of final product 2 a. When compound 8 and an excess amount of formaldehyde (2 equivalent) were employed under the standard conditions or catalyst-free condition, the unstable N-methylene dimer 9 was obtained as the major product (Scheme 6, eq. 4). Furthermore. product 9 could be generated by reacting 2 a with additional formaldehyde under the standard conditions (Scheme 6, eq. 5). These results suggested that a small amount of formaldehyde might be generated in situ, and which subsequently reacted with product 2a to yield the byproduct 9. When compound 8 and 1 equivalent of formaldehyde or acetaldehyde were employed under the standard conditions, the corresponding cyclic condensation products 2a and 10 were obtained smoothly, respectively(Scheme 6, eqs. 6-7).

These results suggested that the ringopening hydrolysis compound 8 was generated in situ and served as a key intermediate for the formation of cyclic oxazinane ring. Thus, it is reasonable to deduce the possible reaction pathway by considering these observed compounds(7,8,9 and 10) as key intermediates or by-products (see the Supporting Information 3.3 for more details of mechanistic discussion).\nBased on the results described above and relevant studies, $^{[15]}$ aplausible reaction pathway is depicted in Scheme 7. The reaction starts from SET oxidation of TH $\\beta C$ 1a by $Cu^{II}$ species, resulting in the formation of the 3-radical iminium cation intermediate M1. The carbon radical is oxygenated by $O_{2}$ to generate the peroxy radical, which is subsequently reduced by CuI species and protonated with $H_{2}O$ to form the hydroperoxide intermediate M2. Then, the imine cation undergoes nucleophilic attack by $H_{2}O,$ generating the vicinal hydroxyl hydroperoxide intermediate M3. Following this, the release of hydrogen peroxide gives dearomatized intermediate M4, which is quickly re-aromatized to form the epoxide M5. The ring-opening of M5 yields the imino alcohol 7 (M6), which is then trapped by $H_{2}O_{2}$ to form the hydroxy hydroperoxide intermediate M7. Notably, the process involved external $H_{2}O$ attacks to intermediate M4 and subsequent release of $H_{2}O$ to from the 7 (M6) can not be completely excluded (see Supporting Information 3.5 for more details). The O-O bond homolysis of M7, enabled by $Cu^{I}$ species, triggers ring opening of the piperidine ring of M7, forming the a-amino radical intermediate M8. Then. SET oxidation of M8 by $Cu^{II}$ species to form iminium ion M9, which is hydrolyzed to M11 via hemiaminal M10 along with the release of formaldehyde. Subsequently, M11 undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic addition to give intermediate M12. The intermediate M12 can be further transformed to intermediate 8 (M13). Finally, the cyclization process is achieved through the condensation of the hydroxy and aniline groups with formaldehyde, which is generated in situ,\nLCu,,H\nLcu\n1313\n342\nH2O2\n7(M6)\nM5\nM4\n$\\begin{matrix}Cu' \\space & \\space \\lfloor \\end{matrix}$ Cu', $HO^{-}$\n肌\nLCull\n$H_{2}O$\nM8\nM9\nM10\n$CH_{2}O$\n()\n$CH_{2}O$\nNBn\n$NH_{2}\\\\ 8(M13)$\nM12\nM11\nyielding the product 2 a. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) computations was also performed to provide insights into the functions of two copper catalysts. The results showed that the presence of counter anion OAcmay stabilize the CuI species and promote the SET oxidation process. (see Supporting Information 4.2 for more details of calculations).\nIn conclusion, we have developed a copper-catalyzed oxygenation rearrangement reaction of TH $\\beta$ Cs using $H_{2}O$ and $O_{2}$ as oxygen sources, providing a novel and highly efficient method for the construction of the spiro[pyrrolidone-(3,1-benzoxazine)] scaffold. This openflask method is safe and simple to operate, and no other chemical oxidants are required. This protocol features high chemoselectivity, excellent functional-group tolerance, and broad synthetic utility for the rapid assembly of challenging natural products and the 3-hydroxyl-pyrroloindoline scaffold. Mechanistic studies revealed that the unusual 2-hydroxyl-3-peroxide indoline species, as a new versatile synthetic intermediate, is generated in situ, and its reactions proceed via an unprecedent multi-step bond cleavage and formation cascade. This skeletal rearrangement strategy enriches the field of rearrangement chemistry, and provides new insights for the structural evolution of donaxanine alkaloid skeleton. Other useful reaction design and further in-depth mechanistic studies are ongoing in our lab.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China(22061010,22201053,22261010), Guizhou Province Science and Technology Foundation, China (QKHJC[2022]294, QKHZYD[2022]4015) for financial support.\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nData Availability Statement\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available in the supplementary material of this article.\nKeywords: Copper .

While trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is an inexpensive and easily accessible reagent, its use as a source of CF3 is highly challenging due to its high oxidation potential. In this study, we present a novel electrophotochemical approach that enables the use of TFA as the $CF_{3}$ source for the selective, catalyst- and oxidant-free trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes. Key to our approach is the selective oxidation of TFA over arenes, generating $CF_{3}$ radicals through oxidative decarboxylation. This strategy enables the sustainable and environmentally-friendly synthesis of $CF_{3}-$ , $CF_{2}H-$ and perfluoroalkyl-containing(hetero)arenes with a broad range of substrates. Importantly, our results demonstrate significantly improved chemoselectivity by light irradiation, opening up new possibilities for the synthetic and medicinal applications of TFA as an ideal yet underutilized CF3 source.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe trifluoromethyl ( $CF_{3})$ group is a highly valuable moiety in medicinal chemistry due to its electron-withdrawing nature, high lipophilicity, and unique physicochemical properties that enhance binding selectivity, cell membrane permeability, and in vivo metabolic stability of drug molecules. $CF_{3}-$ substituted aromatic rings are commonly found in various pharmaceutical drugs, such as fluoxetine, cinacalcet, hydroxyflutamide, dutasteride, selinexor, and travoprost. To facilitate the direct trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes, many $CF_{3}$ reagents, including Langlois' reagent ( $CF_{3}SO_{2}$ $CF_{3}SO_{2}$ Cl, $^{9}CF_{3}I,^{10}$ Togni's reagent, $^{11}TMSCF_{3},^{12}$ and Umemoto reagent, $^{13}$ have been utilized, but they are often expensive, toxic, require lengthy preparation, and generate substantial chemical wastes (Figure 1a). Therefore, it is highly desirable to identify an abundant, cost-effective, and green trifluoromethyl source.\nTrifluoroacetic acid (TFA) appears to be an attractive $CF_{3}$ source from both economic and sustainability perspectives, as it is inexpensive, readily available, and produces only $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}$ as byproducts in the reaction. However, the high oxidation potential of TFA (>+2.24 V vs SCE) $^{14}$ has presented significant challenges in its use as a trifluoromethylation reagent. Previous studies required stoichiometric or excess amounts of strong oxidants, such as silver salts, which lead to poor functional group tolerance and overoxidation.15 Moreover, (hetero)arenes of similar oxidation potentials, such as benzene $(E_{p}=2.64$ Vvs SCE) $,^{16}$ may also undergo competing oxidation, producing undesired byproducts.\nIn recent years, photocatalysis has emerged as a promising strategy for activating inert compounds in a selective and mild manner. Numerous photocatalytic methods have been developed to generate $CF_{3}$ radicals from TFA derivatives, notably trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) for effecting trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes, and $CF_{3}-$ bearing Nhydroxybenzimidoyl chloride (NHBC) ester derivatives, which find application in the hydrofluoroalkylation of unactivated olefins. 17 Despite these advances, the direct utilization of TFA as a primary source of $CF_{3}$ radicals remains constrained, even within the domain of photocatalysis. Notably, in 2017, Li and co-workers utilized TFA as a $CF_{3}$ reagent for the trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes, using Rh-modified $TiO_{2}$ nanoparticles as the photocatalyst and a substoichiometric amount of $Na_{2}S_{2}O_{8}$ as an external oxidant. Although the use of strong oxidants was avoided in both cases, an external activating reagent was still required to facilitate the reaction due to the limited redox window of photocatalysts.\nACS Publications\n24965\nOn the other hand, electrochemistry is a potent technique that employs electrons and holes as \"traceless\" reagents over a broad redox window to reduce reliance on conventional chemical oxidants and reductants. In view of the pressing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable synthesis, electrochemistry has undergone a renaissance in the realm of organic synthesis. $^{19}$ Nevertheless, electrochemistry faces certain restrictions due to issues such as inadequate mass transfer, large ohmic drop in organic solvents, electrode passivation, and excessive oxidation/reduction. $^{20}$\nOver the past few years, there has been a growing trend of integrating electrochemical and photocatalytic activation techniques via electrophotochemical synthesis. This integration has created a wide range of possibilities for the development of innovative synthetic transformations, both in terms of mechanism and operation. $^{21}$ We herein present our successful implementation of electrophotochemical synthesis for the trifluoromethylation of arenes using TFA, highlighting an unprecedented discovery of enhanced product selectivity by photoirradiation (Figure 1b).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nOur investigation was initiated with benzene (1a) as the model substrate to explore the reaction conditions for trifluoromethylation using TFA (2a, 2.0 equiv) (Table 1). Optimal results were obtained in $CH_{3}$ CN with a constant current of 5 mA in an undivided cell equipped with a graphite plate anode and a platinum plate cathode, under 390 nm LED irradiation at room temperature. The desired $CF_{3}-$ product 3a was obtained in 74$\\%$yield with 5$\\%$ of di- $CF_{3}$ side products (entry 1). Changing either the anode material to reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC)\nArticle\n$^{a}$ Optimal conditions: benzene (0.5mmol), TFA (2.0 equiv), n- $Bu_{4}NBF_{4}(0.5$ mmol), $CH_{3}$ CN(5mL).

When platinum was used as the anode material, no desired product was generated (entry 3). It is noteworthy that in the absence of light, a significant amount(33$\\%$) of phenyl trifluoroacetate 4a was obtained as a byproduct (entry 5). We assessed the effect of light sources with different wavelengths of 370,427,440, and 456 nm (entries 6-9) and observed that the formation of byproduct 4a was generally suppressed in the presence of light irradiation. Importantly, we observed low selectivity of 3a and 4a(60$\\%$vs30$\\%$)whenthereactionwasperformedat $45 ^\\circ\\text{C} in$ an oil bath (entry 10), indicating that the good selectivity of 3a under the optimal conditions was attributed to light irradiation rather than the heating effect. When the reaction was conducted under a constant voltage (3.5 V), a lower product selectivity was observed between the formation of 3a and 4a(entry 11). Finally, we confirmed that electricity was a prerequisite as no reaction occurred in its absence (entry 12).\nUtilizing optimized reaction conditions, we conducted a scope investigation of the trifluoromethylation reaction utilizing TFA as the $CF_{3}$ source across a range of (hetero) arenes (Table 2). Our results demonstrate that monosubstituted arenes with a diverse array of functional groups, including halogens (F,Cl,Br,I)(3b-3e),ketones(3f,3g), esters(3h,3i),difluoromethyl(3j),trifluoromethyl(3k), nitrile (3l), pinacol boronic ester (3m), sulfonyl (3n), and phosphate (3o), were well-tolerated with synthetically useful yields. Disubstituted benzenes featuring electron-withdrawing groups, including 1,2-(3q-3s) and 1,4-disubstitution(3t-3ah), as well as substrates containing two aromatic rings (3ai), were also trifluoromethylated with moderate yields. The regioselectivity of the reaction varied depending on the substrate. Specifically, when Disubstituted arenes contained an additional $CF_{3}$ group, trifluoromethylation preferentially occurred metato the $CF_{3}$ group (3ad-3ah). Moreover, it is worth noting that\n24966\n$^{a}$ Arenes(0.5mmol),TFA(2equiv),n- $Bu_{4}NBF_{4}(0.5$ mmol), $CH_{3}$ CN (5 mL).

Furthermore, the trifluoromethylation of heteroaromatic compounds, which are often challenging substrates when subjected to electrochemical conditions due to their susceptibility to oxidation, has been achieved successfully. Pyridines carrying chloro, bromo, and ester substituents have been effectively employed, yielding products 3ak-3ao in moderate to good yields. Additionally, thiophenes have demonstrated compatibility, providing the corresponding trifluoromethylated products (3ap-3aq).\nTo demonstrate the practical utility and versatility of our electrophotochemical protocol, we explored its potential in the late-stage functionalization (LSF) of complex pharmaceuticals, natural products, and their derivatives (Figure 2a).

Furthermore, substrates derived from menthol, adamantane, stanolone, and L-threitol exhibited favorable reactivity within this framework. Additionally, we successfully scaled up this electrophotochemical trifluoromethylation reaction to a 50.0 mmol scale, resulting in the isolation of over 10 g of product 3r in 77$\\%$ yield (Figure 2b). The attainment of LSF and the remarkable scalability, often a challenging feat in electrochemical reactions, underscore the practical applicability of our method, particularly in the domain of medicinal chemistry.\nThe incorporation of perfluoroalkyl groups (Rf $= \\space C_{2}H_{5}$ , $C_{3}F_{7},C_{4}F_{9},C_{5}F_{11},C_{6}F_{13}$ ,etc.) into drug molecules is also a matter of great importance, as the fluorous chain can significantly improve the metabolic stability of the parent molecules. $^{4,22}$ Our electrophotochemical protocol can be extended to the perfluoroalkylation of arenes using various readily available polyfluoric acids as perfluoroalkylating reagents, as illustrated in Table 3. polyfluoric acids 2b-2f, possessing oxidation potentials (2.10-2.35 V vs Ag/AgCl), exhibited comparable reactivity to that of TFA and were successfully incorporated onto arene laj with moderate yields. Additionally, we endeavored to extend our protocol to the difluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing difluoroacetic acid (2g). With an oxidation potential of 2.09 V vs Ag/AgCl, difluoroacetic acid exhibited the capability to facilitate\n24967\nArticle\nTable 3. Scope of Other Fluoroalkyl Carboxylic Acids for the Per- and $Difluoroalkylation^{a}$\ndifluoromethylation reactions with both arenes and heteroarenes under our established conditions, affording products 5g and 6g in moderate yields. The successful implementation of this methodology in both perfluoroalkylation and difluoroalkylation employing the readily available corresponding carboxylic acids not only broadens the synthetic scope of this protocol but also advances the prospects for the future development of per- and difluoroalkyl compounds for drug discovery.\nVarious experiments were conducted to gain insight of the reaction mechanisms. When 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) was used as a radical trapping reagent under the standard reaction conditions, the reaction was suppressed, and TEMPO- $CF_{3}$ adduct was detected $by^{19}F$ NMR spectroscopy (Figure 3a). Additionally, formations of both $H_{2}$ and $CO_{2}$ were detected under the standard reaction conditions (Figure 3b). All these control experiments supported the generation of $CF_{3}$ radical from TFA via oxidative decarboxylation.\nWe were intrigued by the observed enhancement of chemoselectivity toward the desired trifluoromethylation reaction over the trifluoroacetoxylation side reaction under light irradiation and sought to investigate this effect further. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have reported this light-enhanced chemoselectivity under electrochemical conditions. In order to probe the effect of light, we conducted cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of benzene and $CF_{3}CO_{2}$ Na in acetonitrile with and without light irradiation. The small difference in oxidative potential between $CF_{3}CO_{2}Na$ and benzene (0.14 V, Figure 3c) indicated the challenge in achieving selective oxidation of TFA in the presence of benzene. Furthermore, the impact of light on the oxidation potential of both substrates was minimal, ruling out photo differentiation of the substrates' oxidative potentials as the origin of the observed improved selectivity.\nTo explore this effect further, we conducted photocurrent response measurements by switching on and off an LED light\n24968\nJ.

The Palladium-Catalyzed\nArticle\n(390nm,75W) with a voltage of 2.5V(vsAg/AgCl) for the background acetonitrile solvent, benzene, and $CF_{3}CO_{2}Na$ using a graphite plate anode. Our results showed that under light irradiation, a photocurrent was generated with both $CF_{3}CO_{2}$ Na and benzene, with $CF_{3}CO_{2}$ Na exhibiting a significantly higher current intensity than benzene (Figure 3d). However, in the absence of light, the current intensity of both $CF_{3}CO_{2}$ Na and benzene diminished. This observation suggested that $CF_{3}CO_{2}^{-}$ is oxidized more readily than benzene under light irradiation, and are align with the observed improvement in selectivity for product 3a under electrophotochemical conditions. One possible explanation is that the graphite plate anode, although conductive, may undergo oxidation at the anodic potential applied. This oxidation process introduces a band gap in the graphite, making it responsive to light irradiation and allowing the formation of electron-hole pairs. $^{23,24}$ This suspicion was experimentally supported by the increased current under light irradiation of the background MeCN solvent (as depicted in Figure 3d, black line). The increased generation of charge carriers in the graphite plate anode may have contributed to the higher photocurrent observed for $CF_{3}CO_{2}$ Na compared to benzene under light irradiation. As $CF_{3}CO_{2}^{-}$ is attracted more strongly to the positively charged anode, improved mass transfer via electromigration likely occurs. In contrast, there was no such ion interaction between neutral benzene and the anode. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the generation of hot electrons in graphite under light irradiation that triggers the ion interactions, even though the hot electrons and holes dissipate in ultrafast time scales.25\nBased on all the experimental studies, a reaction mechanism was proposed as shown in Figure 3e. Under light-irradiation, the enhanced mass transfer due to ion interactions under electrophotochemical conditions facilitates anodic oxidation of TFA, leading to the formation of $CF_{3}$ radical via decarboxylation. This radical subsequently adds to benzene to generate intermediate int-1, which is converted to the desired product 3a through another single electron oxidation and deprotonation. In contrast, in the absence of light, the oxidation of benzene becomes a prominent side reaction. Nucleophilic attack of $CF_{3}CO_{2}^{-}$ to the phenyl radical cation (int-2) forms int-3, which furnishes fluoroacetoxylation product 4a through oxidative rearomatization on the anode. Meanwhile, the released protons undergo single-electron reduction to produce $H_{2}$ on the cathode.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have developed a electrophotochemical approach for the direct trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes using TFA as a sustainable $CF_{3}$ source, in the absence of any catalyst or oxidant. Our reaction conditions permit various electron-neutral and electron-poor (hetero)arenes to serve as the substrates. This straightforward protocol can readily be extended to encompass perfluoroalkylation and difluoroalkylation by leveraging commercially available polyfluoric acids and difluoroacetic acid, respectively. The unprecedented photoinduced chemoselective enhancement can be attributed to the acceleration of the oxidation of $CF_{3}CO_{2}^{-}$ under anodic light irradiation. Our investigation not only offers new prospects for the synthetic application of TFA as a $CF_{3}$ source, but also introduces a novel approach to integrate light and electrochemical reactions for achieving otherwise challenging organic transformations.\n24969\nArticle\nTrifluoromethylation of Aryl Chlorides.

The resulting cocrystals TT-R (R=H, F, Cl, Br, or I) transform the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emission in the TT-H, TT-F, and TT-Cl cocrystals to room-temperature phosphorescence in the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals. Definite crystal packing structures demonstrate a 1:1 alternative donor-acceptor stacking in the TT-H cocrystal, a 2:1 alternative donor-acceptor stacking in the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals, and a separate stacking of donor and acceptor in the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals. A transformation law can be revealed that with an increase in atomic number from H, F, Cl, Br, to I, the cocrystals show the structural transformation of the number of aggregated TX-R molecules from monomers to dimers and finally to multimers. This work will facilitate an understanding of the effect of halogen substituents on the crystal packing structure and luminescence properties in the cocrystals.\n$\\bigcirc$ rganic luminescent materials have shown application prospects of commercialization for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) $,^{1}$ organic light-emitting transistors(OLETs), bioprobes, sensors, etc., due to their excellent molecular tailoring capability, low cost, large-area fabrication, flexibility, and light weight. When using the organic luminescent materials, improving the exciton-utilizing efficiency is an important scientific issue, especially for the harvest of triplet excitons, which promotes the continuous development and innovation in the organic luminescent materials. $S^{5-8}$ Nevertheless, how to improve the exciton-utilizing efficiency of organic luminescent materials remains challenging. For instance, in an electroluminescence process, the generated singlet and triplet excitons from charge recombination have a ratio of 1:3 according to the spin statistics rule; however, only singlet excitons are spin-allowed and contribute to a maximum exciton-utilizing efficiency of 25$\\%$ in traditional fluorescencebased devices, which limits the device efficiency. To break through the limit of exciton-utilizing efficiency, some mainstream mechanisms have been proposed, including roomtemperature phosphorescence (RTP) $,^{10}$ thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) $,^{11}$ triplet-triplet annihilation(TTA) $,^{12}$ and \"hot exciton\",13 to make full use of triplet excitons. Specifically, RTP-based materials can utilize nearly 100$\\%$ excitons through the accelerated intersystem crossing(ISC) from the singlet to the triplet excitons. $^{14}$ TADF materials utilize the triplet excitons through a reversed ISC(RISC) process from the excited triplet state to the lowest excited singlet state $(S_{1}),$ mainly benefiting from a small $S_{1}-T_{1}$ energy splitting. $^{15}$ The TTA process transforming the triplet states into the singlet states is favorable when the double energy of $T_{1}$ is larger than that of the $S_{1}.^{16}$ \"Hot exciton\" channels can be constructed to utilize the triplet excitons by the RISC process occurring at high-lying levels due to the resonant alignment of the $T_{m}(m \\ge 2)$ and $S_{n}(n \\ge 1)$ energy levels. $^{17}$ In recent decades, nonmetal purely organic materials have emerged as the leading contenders in the field of TADF, TTA, and \"hot exciton\" luminescent materials, with the exception of metal complexes, which traditionally dominated the RTP-based materials. Purely organic materials hardly exhibit the RTP for the reasons that the spin-orbit coupling(SOC) in purely organic systems is weak, which can afford neither the effective ISC for triplet exciton population nor the efficient triplet exciton radiation to surpass all possible nonradiation pathways (e.g., vibrational quenching and oxygen quenching) $.^{18,19}$ Nowadays, the purely organic RTP materials have been developed boomingly by means of enhancing SOC through the introduction of nonmetallic heavy atoms and\nACS Publications\n2690\nLetter\nheteroatoms and suppressing nonradiative transition rates through crystallization, metal-organic frameworks, host-guest doping, polymerization, H-aggregation, etc.\nThese mechanisms, although characterized by intricate excited-state dynamics, have the unique ability to interconvert and even coexist within a single luminescent material, particularly in TADF- and RTP-based materials, which is attractive and challenging in the study of the photophysical foundation and multifunctional applications.24=27 However, manipulation of the excited-state dynamics in TADF- and RTP-based materials primarily occurs at the molecular level and within single-component aggregates. This includes means like structural isomer and conformation-dependent intramolecular charge transfer (CT) for selectively expressing TADF and RTP, $^{28-31}$ changing the CT strength in different donor-acceptor (D-A) molecules to selectively express TADF and RTP, $^{32}$ vibration-regulated transformation between TADF and RTP, $^{33}$ using J-and H-aggregation for selectively expressing TADF and RTP, $^{34}$ and achieving dual emission of TADF and RTP by the coexistence of monomer and dimer species. $^{35}$ As a unique strategy, cocrystallization occurring between two or more conformer components is commonly used to modulate the molecular orientation, which enables cocrystals to exhibit versatile and unpredicted physicochemical properties beyond those of single components through multifunctional synergistic and collective effects. $^{36-38}$ Nevertheless, a second component is rarely employed to modulate TADF and RTP, $^{39,40}$ and the effect of molecular orientation between two different components on TADF and RTP properties is far from fully understood.\nCocrystals can be formed via noncovalent intermolecular interactions,such as CT interactions, $^{41}\\pi - \\pi$ interactions,42 halogen bonds, $^{43}$ and hydrogen bonds. $^{44}$ Considering that the CT state is important to modulate TADF and RTP, consequently, cocrystals composed of donors and acceptors are preferentially studied. Among the reported CT cocrystals, changing the donor type is a commonly employed strategy due to the wide variety of donor molecules available, which offers significantly more design flexibility.45\nThioxanthone (TX) is a promising molecule for generating triplet states due to its substantial SOC coefficients and a small singlet-triplet energy splitting, $^{46-48}$ which allows it to achieve RTP emission. $^{49-51}$ In this work, we choose TX and its halogenated TX derivatives TX-R (R = H, F, Cl, Br, or I) as donors and 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) as an acceptor to noncovalently synthesize five cocrystals TT-R (R=H, F, Cl, Br, or I) for modulating TADF and RTP emission. As the atomic number increases in the order of H, F, Cl, Br, and I, the cocrystals show a single emission of TADF (for the TT-H, TTF, and TT-Cl cocrystals) and a single emission of RTP (for the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals), accompanied by a color ranging from green to yellow (Figure 1). This transformation from TADF to RTP mainly originates from the evolution of TX-Rbased aggregates from monomer and dimer to multimer, which is supported by definite crystal structures, photophysical measurements, and theoretical analysis. Moreover, the TT-H\n2691\nLetter\ncocrystal has a high-efficiency TADF emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 72$\\%$, and the TT-I cocrystal has a high-efficiency RTP emission with a PLQY of 28$\\%$. This work not only offers a potential avenue for manipulating the TADF and RTP properties of TX derivatives but also sheds light on the effect of the number of donor molecules in the CT cocrystals on their luminescent properties.\nThe cocrystals were prepared using a solvent evaporation method. TX-R (R=H, F, Cl, Br, or I) and TCNB were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1 and dissolved in a saturated solution of mixed dichloromethane and methanol; then, the solvents were allowed to evaporate slowly, resulting in the precipitation of the cocrystals. The obtained cocrystals have a block-like morphology, as shown in Figure 1a, making them easily distinguishable from the individual single-component crystals(Figure S1).\nIn the absorption spectra (Figures 1b and S2a), the cocrystals exhibit obviously red-shifted absorption onset compared to their individual components, indicating the presence of certain intermolecular interactions between TX derivatives and TCNB. The evident difference of the cocrystals and the constituent TCNB and TX derivative crystals is also found in their emission spectra at room temperature (RT)(Figures 1c and S2b). The emission spectra of the cocrystals can be classified into two categories based on their shape and position characteristics. First, the TT-H, TT-F, and TT-Cl cocrystals all have a featureless broad emission band (their full width at half maximums (FWHMs) are 71, 87, and 95 nm, respectively) peaking at 522, 530, and 523 nm with a PLQY of 72$\\%$, 44$\\%$, and 51$\\%$, respectively (Figure 1a). By contrast, TCNB has near-ultraviolet emission peaking at 336 nm, while the TX, TX-F, and TX-Cl crystals have dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in the short- and long-wavelength regions, respectively (Figure $S2b).^{49}$ Second, the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals show featureless broad bands (FWHM is 116 nm for the TT-Br cocrystal and 105 nm for the TT-I cocrystal) peaking at 570 and 555 nm with PLQYs of 20$\\%$ and 28$\\%$, respectively. The emission spectra of these two cocrystals are red-shifted compared to those of the TT-H, TT-F, and TT-Cl cocrystals and are also different from their constituent TX-Br and TX-I crystals with dual emission of fluorescence and RTP. $^{49}$ Moreover, the time-resolved emission spectra demonstrate the long-lived characters of these cocrystals (Figures 1d and le and Table S1). The long-lived characters indicate that these cocrystals may show RTP, TADF, or TTA properties instead of \"hot exciton\" properties, given that \"hot exciton\" materials typically show lifetimes on the nanosecond scale. $^{10-13}$\nTo characterize the underlying photophysics of the excitedstate species of these cocrystals, we carried out temperaturedependent emission spectra and temperature-dependent timeresolved emission spectra (Figure S3). For the TT-H cocrystal, the time-resolved emission spectra reveal the presence of two distinct emission components (Figure id): a prompt fluorescence with a lifetime of 22.85 ns and a delayed fluorescence with a much longer lifetime of $4.49 \\space \\mu s,$ indicative of a potential TADF property. To confirm the TADF emission of the TT-H cocrystal, the temperature-dependent timeresolved emission spectra were collected from 80 to 360 K. as shown in Figures S3a and S3b. The ratio of the delayed component gradually increases as the temperature rises, demonstrating a thermal activation process responsible for TADF generation. $^{52}$ In order to further determine the $\\Delta E_{ST}$ between the lowest singlet $(S_{1})$ and the lowest triplet $(T_{1})$ states in the TT-H cocrystal, the emissive spectra at low temperatures were measured. As shown in Figures S3c and S3d, a new emission peak appears at around 550 nm for the TT-H cocrystal at 80 K; with a delayed time of 180 ms, the phosphorescence emission peak at 550 nm becomes dominant. Thus, the $\\Delta E_{ST}$ was estimated to be 0.13 eV, which is small enough to facilitate the TADF emission instead of TTA emission in the TT-H cocrystal. $^{53}$\nFor the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals, the time-resolved emission spectra show the presence of both prompt and delayed decay components, and the temperature-dependent time-resolved emission spectra show an increased ratio in the delayed component as the temperature rises (Figure S4), which suggest TADF emission with the emission peaks at 530 and 523 nm in the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals, respectively. Their TADF properties are further supported by the close emission peaks to that of the TT-H cocrystal. Regarding the TT-Cl cocrystal as a prototype, its time-resolved emission spectrum controlled at 80 K shows the obviously elongated lifetime, indicating the contribution of phosphorescence to the long-wavelength emission. However, the phosphorescence peaks are hardly recorded due to the undifferentiated lifetimes monitored at different wavelengths (Figure $S4).^{54,55}$ In the cases of the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals, both of them present long lifetimes, which show decreased trends as the temperature rises from 80 to 360 K (Figure S5). Thus, the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals demonstrate the RTP characteristics.\nAs presented above, incorperating these five TX derivatives with TCNB in cocrystals contributes to two kinds of excited states, behaving as the emission of TADF and RTP. Just by increasing the atomic number of subtituent atoms (H, F, CI, Br, or I) on the TX skeleton, the transformation of the excitedstate property is undoubtedly intriguing. Next, structural analysis will provide the solid foundation for an in-depth understanding of the distinct excited-state properties.\nThe crystal structures of high-quality cocrystals were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) experiments, and crystallographic data and refined data are summarized in Table S2. The TT-H cocrystal presents a longrange $\\pi - \\pi$ packing column mode with a 1:1 alternating stacking of TX and TCNB along the a axis of the unit cell(Figure 2a). The interplanar distance is 3.453 A (measured from the centroid of TCNB to the plane of TX), where the benzene ring of the TCNB shows a large overlap with the TX molecule, demonstrating a strong intermolecular interaction between the TCNB and TX molecules. The columns spread toward the bc plane through multiple $-C-H \\cdots N \\equiv C-$ and $-C-H \\cdots O=C-$ interactions (Figure S6). Through theoretical calculations of the frontier molecular orbitals on TCNB and TX derivatives (Figure 2b), TCNB serves as an acceptor relative to the TX derivatives. Therefore, incorporating the TCNB acceptor and the TX donor through alternating stacking in the resulting cocrystal produces CT interactions and facilitates a small $\\breve{\\Delta E}_{ST},$ which contributes to the TADF emission in the TT-H cocrystal. Similar to the TT-H cocrystal, the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals also show a long-range $\\pi - \\pi$ stacking column mode with alternating TCNB and TX-F (or TX-Cl) along the c axis of the unit cell, but with a ratio of 1:2(Figures 2, S7, and S8). The columns spread toward the ab plane through multiple $-C-H \\cdots N \\equiv C-,-C-H \\cdots O=C-$ , $-C-H \\cdots F$ (orCl)-C-,and $-C \\cdots O=C-$ interactions(Figures S7 and S8). The interplanar distance between\n2692\nLetter\nTCNB and TX-F (or TX-Cl) is 3.531 A(or 3.511 A)(measured from the centroid of TCNB to the TX-based plane), where TCNB shows certain overlap with the TX-F (or TX-Cl) molecule, demonstrating a strong intermolecular CT interaction between TCNB and TX-F(or TX-Cl). This CT can be used to rationalize the TADF properties of the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals. Surprisingly, the donor TX-F (or TXCl) molecules stack pairwise in an antiparallel manner and also have strong intermolecular interactions with an interplanar distance of 3.462 A(or 3.513 A). This particular molecular stacking pattern in the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals may contribute to the observed luminescence phenomena mentioned above. Theoretical calculations on natural transition orbitals (NTOs) were conducted to investigate the structureproperty relationship, and dimer (TX $-H \\cdots$ TCNB) and trimer(TX $-F \\cdots TX-F \\cdots$ TCNB or TX-CI $\\cdots$ TX-Cl $\\cdots$ TCNB)models directly taken out from the TT-H, TT-F, and TT-Cl cocrystals were used. As expected, the TX $-H \\cdots$ TCNB dimer shows a separated hole and electron distributed over TX-H and TCNB, respectively, indicating that TX-H and TCNB act as donor and acceptor, respectively; moreover, a very small energy level difference between $S_{1}$ and $T_{1}$ is revealed (Figure S9), which agrees well with the experimental results. Regarding the TX- $F \\cdots TX-F \\cdots$ TCNB or TX-Cl $\\cdots$ TX-Cl $\\cdots$ TCNB trimer (Figure S10), a hole is distributed over mainly one TX-F or TX-Cl molecule and slightly over the other TX-F or TX-Cl molecule away from TCNB, and an electron is located on the TCNB; furthermore, an even smaller energy gap between $S_{1}$ and $T_{1}$ is observed for the two trimers compared to the dimer, $^{53}$ and thus it is reasonable that the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals exhibit a shorter lifetime, probably due to a faster reverse intersystem crossing process, when compared to the TT-H cocrystal.\nDifferent from the long-range alternative stacking of donor and acceptor in the TT-H, TT-F, and TT-Cl cocrystals, the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals show a one-dimensional long-range $\\pi - \\pi$ arrangement of TX-Br (or TX-I) and TCNB independently (Figures S11 and S13), and there is only a weak $\\pi - \\pi$ stacking interaction between TX-Br(or TX-I) and TCNB. The TX-Br and TX-Cl molecules slip along the a axis of the unit cell, accompanied by interplanar distances of 3.406 and 3.498 A as well as angles of $28.46^{\\circ}$ and $27.76^{\\circ}$ , respectively. It is noteworthy that in the individual TX-Br and TX-I single crystals, the molecules propagate in the onedimensional long-range $\\pi - \\pi$ packing mode, and RTP emissions were observed at around 580 nm, accompanied by the fluorescence emission. The phosphorescence efficiency of the individual TX-Br and TX-I single crystals are 17.6$\\%$ and $0.1 $\\%$ ,^{49}$ respectively, while the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals show the RTP emission with improved efficiencies (20$\\%$ for the TTBr cocrystal and 28$\\%$ for the TT-I cocrystal). Improved efficiencies can be ascribed to multiple $-C-H \\cdots N \\equiv C-, \\space -C-$ $H \\cdots O=C-,-C \\equiv N \\cdots Br-C-,-C \\cdots O=C-$ ,and $I \\cdots I$ interactions (Figures S11 and S13). Therefore, a rigid threedimensional network in the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals can be formed via multiple intermolecular interactions, which shows a different and compact stacking orientation compared to those of single-component TX-Br and TX-I crystals. These intermolecular interactions can largely reduce nonradiative energy dissipation, avoid the invasion of atmospheric oxygen, and contribute to the stabilization of the triplet excitons, which result in improved phosphorescence efficiency.\nOn the whole, the transformation from TADF to RTP in these cocrystals corresponds to the structural evolution of guest molecules from monomer (in the TT-H cocrystal) to dimer (in the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals) and finally multimer(in the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals)(Figure 3). Moreover, the\n2693\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2024, 15, 2690-2696\nLetter\nstructural evolution is found to be regular, that is, following the increasing atomic number of substituent atoms (H, F, Cl, Br, and I) on the TX skeleton. However, the crystal packing structure may be subjected to multiple factors, such as electrostatic potential (ESP), steric hindrance, and intermolecular interactions. In this contribution, on the one hand, the introduction of TCNB facilitates the construction of multiple $-C-H \\cdots N \\equiv C-$ interactions, as observed from the crystal structure of each cocrystal, and thus these $-C-H \\cdots N \\equiv C-$ interactions are not main factors affecting molecular packing patterns. On the other hand, with the increasing atomic number of the substituent atom (H, F, Cl, Br, and I) on the TX skeleton, the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbital and the molecular ESP are almost unchanged (Figures 2b and 4a), and therefore, TX derivative molecules and TCNB may adopt proper molecular orientation under the induction of ESP. It is found that from TT-H to TT-F (or TT-Cl) and to TT-Br(or TT-I) cocrystals, the overlapped area between the benzene ring of TCNB and the TX skeleton gradually decreases (Figure 4b), which can be ascribed to the effect of steric hindrance of halogen atoms, that is, as the atomic number of the substituent atom (H,F,Cl,Br,and I) increases,the steric hindrance becomes larger and larger on the TX skeleton. This effect is also found in the single-crystal structures of TX derivatives.49 Therefore, under the induction of molecular ESP, steric hindrance might be one of the main factors affecting the crystal packing structures.\nIn conclusion, through the regulation of crystal engineering, the incorporation of the TCNB acceptor with halogensubstituent TX derivative donors facilitates the formation of different stacking arrangements, including 1:1 alternative donor-acceptor stacking in the TT-H cocrystal, 2:1 alternative donor-acceptor stacking in the TT-F and TT-Cl cocrystals, and separate stacking of donor and acceptor in the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals. The difference in the molecular stacking modes may result from the synergistic effect between ESP and steric hindrance. These distinct stacking modes lead to different excited-state characteristics: the TT-H, TT-F, and TT-Cl cocrystals exhibit the TADF property, while the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals show the pure RTP emission. Especially, the TT-Br and TT-I cocrystals exhibit higher RTP efficiency than those of individual TX-Br and TX-I single crystals, and the high efficiency can be attributed to the abundant hydrogen bonds formed iin the cocrystals, which greatly suppress the nonradiative pathways. Through cocrystal engineering, the gradual regulation of TX-R molecules from monomer (TT-H) to dimer (TT-F and TT-Cl) and then to long-range stacking multimer (TT-Br and TT-I) is realized for the first time, accompanied by the gradual conversion of the luminescence mechanism from pure TADF emission to pure RTP emission. For this system, the singlet and triplet excitons are both harvested to break through the exciton statistics limit. The cocrystallization strategy in TX derivatives provides new insight for exploring the photophysical mechanism to enhance the exciton utilization efficiency.\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nsi Supporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c00160.\nGeneral information, luminescence images of cocrystals, absorption spectra of cocrystals, emission spectra of cocrystals, temperature-dependent time-resolved emission spectra of cocrystals, temperature-dependent emission spectra of cocrystals, table for photophysical data, table for single-crystal X-ray crystallography, crystal packing structures of cocrystals, excited-state energy level distribution, and NTOs (PDF)\nAccession Codes\nCCDC 2325696-2325700 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Authors\nHaichao Liu - State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, P.

There is a lack of a biocompatible and general radical-generation mechanism, as nature prefers to avoid radicals that may be harmful to biological $systems^{9}.$ Here we repurpose a ThDP-dependent lyase as a stereoselective radical acyl transferase (RAT) through protein engineering and combination with organophotoredox $catalysis^{10}.$ Enzyme-bound ThDP-derived ketyl radicals are selectively generated through single-electron oxidation by a photoexcited organic dye and then cross-coupled with prochiral alkyl radicals with high enantioselectivity. Diverse chiral ketones are prepared from aldehydes and redox-active esters (35 examples, up to 97$\\%$enantiomeric excess (e.e.)) by this method. Mechanistic studies reveal that this previously elusive dual-enzyme catalysis/photocatalysis directs radicals with the unique ThDP cofactor and evolvable active site. This work not only expands the repertoire of biocatalysis but also provides a unique strategy for controlling radicals with enzymes, complementing existing chemical tools.\nRadicals are highly reactive intermediates that have translational potential in molecule making for many disciplines, such as natural product synthesis, materials science, drugs and industrial $manufacturing^{11,12}.$ However, inherently reactive radicalintermediates make thecontrol of chemoselectivities and stereoselectivities a long-standing $challenge^{13}.$ Despite the recent elegant chemocatalytic systems for selective radical $reactions^{4}$ ,enzymaticstrategiesand mechanisticschemes need to be explored.\nMost enzymes are evolved to undergo two-electron pathways wherever possible, whereas radical $enzymes^{9,14}$ involving single-electrontransfer steps are less common. Take ThDP-dependent enzymes that are widely distributed in all organisms as $examples^{5}.$ Typically, they catalyse a variety of C-C bond-forming (or bond-breaking) reactions through nucleophilic addition (or the reverse) of the umpolung carbanion-enamine (Breslow intermediate) with different electrophiles(Fig.1a), among which the most famous one is benzoin condensations catalysed by benzaldehyde lyase (BAL) $^{15}.$ Although a few early studies revealed that pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR)-catalysed acetylation of coenzyme A (CoA) proceeds by means of single-electron oxidation $pathways^{16}$ (Fig.1a), the ability of ThDP-dependent enzymes in stereocontrolled radical chemistry remains unknown. Inspired by the versatile enzymatic cofactor ThDP, chemists have developed various biomimetic $NHCs^{6,7}$ functioning as organocatalysts or, more recently, being applied in radical $catalysis^{8}.$ By contrast, expanding the repertoire of enzymes by mimicking NHCs chemocatalysis will be of great significance but so far remains elusive.\nHerewereportadual-catalystsystemconsistingofaThDP-dependent enzyme and an organophotoredox $catalyst^{10}$ to achieve an unnatural enantioselective radical transformation (Fig.1b). A ThDP-dependent BAL is repurposed to be an unprecedented RAT by merging visible-lightinduced single-electron transfer and directed evolution, catalysing acylation of carboxylic-acid-derived prochiral radicals with a plethora of aldehydes (35 examples, up to 97$\\%$ e.e.). Different from the recent non-natural photoenzymatic $catalysis^{14},$ which is typically based on artificial $photoenzymes^{17-19},$ or flavin-dependent/nicotinamide-dependent $oxidoreductases^{20-27},$ this work introducesa new class of radical enzyme and a distinct acyl radical-transfer mechanism, which not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts but also represents an alternative superior to chemo-NHC $catalysts^{8}$ for the stereocontrol of prochiral radicals.\nReaction development and engineering\nWe began our study by selecting 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (1a) as the acyl donor and N-(acyloxy)phthalimide (2a) as the model radical\nprecursor. In the presence of cofactor ThDP and organophotocatalyst eosin Y, a library of ThDP-dependent enzymes was initially screened with irradiation by green light-emitting diodes (530-540-nm LEDs) under a $N_{2}$ atmosphere. Although most of the tested enzymes afforded no product (Supplementary Table 1), only the benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfBAL) showed desirable reactivity, giving target acyl transfer product (S)-3a in 33$\\%$ yield with a 38$\\%$ e.e.(Fig.2b).\nTo improve the reaction efficiency and enantioselectivity, a semi-rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy was $used^{28}.$ First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based on the reported crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code: 3D7K) suggested a possible radical intermediate within the active site of PfBAL (Fig.2c).From the simulated structure, seven amino-acid residues within 5 A of the benzylic radical were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Given that steric hindrance of nearby residues plays a pivotal role in enantioselectivity, we replaced the rationally selected sites with the following amino acids accompanying small, medium and large steric properties: alanine (A) or glycine (G), leucine (L) and phenylalanine (F) or tryptophan (W). Accordingly, 21 mutants were created, purified and subjected to the radical reaction in the first round of evolution. Encouragingly, a mutant T481L (namely, RAT1) delivered a higher turnover number with improved enantioselectivity (89$\\%$ yield, 82$\\%$ e.e. for 3a; also see Supplementary Table 13), whereas mutant A480L gave the best enantioselectivity among the test single-site mutants (93$\\%$ e.e.). Further mutagenesis of 480 and 481 sites to the other four amino acids $L^{+}(L^{+}=$ valine(V), cysteine (C), isoleucine (I), methionine (M)) with a similar size to L proved to have no improvement on enantioselectivity (Supplementary Table 3). Then we refocused on the two variants A480L and T481L, which were used as new parents, respectively, to construct T481L\\_A480G/L/F and A480L\\_T481A/F.Among the five variants, T481L\\_A480L (namely, RAT2) gave the best enantioselectivity, a 96$\\%$ e.e. for (S)-3a. With a smart, focused and high-quality library of variants, the optimal enzyme RAT2 was obtained for the model reaction. Further investigations on reaction parameters (Supplementary Tables 4-9), includingphotoredox catalysts, the pH of reaction buffer, cosolvent and the amount of ThDP, resulted in 60$\\%$yield and 96$\\%$ e.e. for the generation of (S)-3a. Furthermore, control experiments demonstrated that RATs, an inert atmosphere, photocatalyst and green light are all indispensable for the unnatural radical reaction (Fig. 2b).\nSubstrate scope investigations\nWith the optimal conditions and engineered RATs in hand, we turned to thescope survey by using RAT1, RAT2 and RAT3 (RAT1A480G) (Fig.3). A variety of aromatic aldehydes bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the para position were well tolerated(3a-3m). Substituents at the meta or ortho positions of benzaldehyde\nArticle\nFig.3|Scopeinvestigation.Unlessotherwisenoted,standardconditions showninFig.2a were applied. The yields were determined by GC and reported as the average of duplicates. The e.e. was determined by HPLC analysis on a\nchiral stationary phase. Isolated yield based on a 1-mmol reaction. blsolated yield based on a 0.1-mmol reaction.Absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of the single-crystal structures of 3eand 3g.d.r,diastereomericratio. were also accepted (3n and 3o), albeit with lower yields and enantioselectivities. This biotransformation also proceeded smoothly with halogens (3h-3k, 3w-3aa), naphthyl group (3p) and various heteroaryl aldehydes, such as substituted pyrazolyl (3q), pyridinyl (3r), benzothiophenyl (3s) and N-methylindolyl (3t). Diverse N-(acyloxy) phthalimides, which were easily prepared from ubiquitous carboxylic acids, were compatible with the dual catalytic system, providing the corresponding $\\alpha -$ chiral ketones (3u-3ad) ingood yields and excellent enantioselectivities (86-97$\\%$ e.e.). Notably, commercially available racemic anti-inflammatory drugs loxoprofen (3ae) and flurbiprofen(3af) and a naturally occurring aldehyde (3ag) were successfully transformed. A synthetic intermediate (3ah) to a hypoxia-inducible factor $1 \\alpha$ inhibitor could be synthesized in a biocatalytic enantioselective fashion. Furthermore, an aliphatic radical (3ad) and a bulky tertiary radical(3ai) were also acylated enantioselectively, highlighting the versatility of the present catalysis. This reaction can be run ona1-mmolscale and provided 3a and 3g in 52$\\%$ and 85$\\%$ isolated yields, respectively, without a decrease in stereoselectivity. The mild reaction conditions, generality and broad functional-group tolerance make this method an attractive complementary to the synthesis of important $\\alpha -$ chiral ketones.\nWet mechanistic experiments\nOn the basis of the $literature^{8,29},$ we proposed a dual photoredox and biocatalytic mechanism for the non-natural radical enzymatic reaction(Fig. 4a). To begin with, aldehyde reacts with ThDP in the RAT active site to form a key Breslow intermediate (Int. A), which is vulnerable to single-electron $oxidation^{30,31}.$ On the other hand, photoexcitation of eosin Y gives an oxidizing species eosin $Y^{*}(E_{1/2}$ ( $eosinY^{*}/$ eosin $Y^{--})=+0.83$ Vversus saturated calomel electrode) $^{32}.$ Single-electron transfer leads to the formation of a persistent ThDP-derived ketyl radical (Int. B) and eosin Y radical anion, the latter of which is supposed to reduce N-(acyloxy)phthalimide generating the prochiral benzylic radical (Int. $C)(E_{1/2}$ (eosin Y/ $eosinY^{*-})=-1.06$ Vversus saturated\ncalomel electrode). Finally, radical-radical cross-coupling of Int. B and Int. Cformsthe C( $sp^{2})-C(sp^{3})$ bond enantioselectively and releases the catalytically active RAT.\nSeveral experiments support the mechanism. First, when 2,2,6,6-tet ramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO) was subjected to the model reaction as a radical scavenger, the reactivity was inhibited completely and the TEMPO adducts 4 and 5 were observed, exploring the involvement of Int. B and Int. C (Fig. 4b). Second, the generation of Int. C was further confirmed by the isolation of thebenzylic radical homo-coupling side product 8 (Supplementary Methods Section 7.4) and the enantioselective formation of (S)-7 for the reactions starting from(R)-naproxen-derived and (S)-naproxen-derived N-(acyloxy)phthalimides 6 (Fig. 4c). Third, the intermediacy of radicals Int. B and Int. C was further confirmed by low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and room-temperature spin trapping EPR spectroscopy, respectively. A signal detected at low temperature (80 K) under standard conditions was assigned as the key ThDP-derived ketyi radical according to the comparison with a previous $report^{16}$ (Fig.4d). Further control experiments showed that RAT,1a,eosin Yandlight,but not 2a, were essential to the generation of this signal, supporting the proposed mechanism and a reductive quenching photoredox path. Furthermore, the six-line EPR signals, which were detected only under standard conditions with the addition of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), were attributed to the DMPO/benzylic radical adduct, being consistent with the proposed mechanism (Fig. 4e).\nComputational studies\nTo understand the origin of enantioselectivity, the combination of density functional theory calculations and MD simulations was used. Four transition states (TS-S, TS-S', TS-R and TS-R') with different conformations were computed (Fig. 4f). In all of these coupling transition states, there is either cationic $\\pi - \\pi$ interaction or $\\pi - \\pi$ interactionbetween two radical parts. Compared with TS-R and TS-R', S-type configurations have slightly lower energies. This indicates that the formation of the S-product is slightly more favourable once the conformation of the ThDP-derived ketyl radical is fixed by the enzyme. In the MD simulations(Supplementary Figs.7-10), we found that the conformation of TS-R' was unstable in the enzyme pocket and could be converted into the conformation of TS-R eventually (Supplementary Fig.9). Therefore, we analysed the distances between mutated residues (L480 and L481) and three transition states TS-S, TS-S' and TS-R, respectively. As shown in Fig.4g, although residue L481is close to the benzylic radical in all these cases, it is very close to the cationic thiazolyl ring only in TS-S'(4.4 Aversus 8.4 and 9.2 A). Also, the distance between residue 480 and the phenyl ring derived from 4-methoxybenzaldehyde in TS-S' is the shortest. These observations indicate that there is the strongest dispersion $force^{33}(E _{\\text{dispersion}})$ between radical coupling transition state TS-S' and the mutated residues (-9.6 kcal $mol^{-1}$ versus -3.3 and -4.3 kcal $mol^{-1}).$ Our simulations explain the excellent S-selectivity in the challenging radical chemistry controlled with the engineered enzyme.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries,source data,extended data,supplementary information,acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06822-x.\nBell,E.L.et al.Biocatalysis.Nat.Rev.Methods Primers 1,46(2021).\n2.

We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross-coupling of 2-acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N'-dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99 $\\%$ ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88 $\\%$yield). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward access to optically active acyclic carbonyl derivatives starting from simple alkanes without prefunctionalization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments were made to gain insight into the nature of C-C bond formation and the origin of enantioselectivity. We propose a radical-radical crosscoupling process enabled by the immediate interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species.\nIntroduction\nThe catalytic asymmetric a-alkylation of carbonyls with diverse alkyl electrophiles is a pivotal and widely applicable method for constructing a-stereogenic carbonyl motifs. $^{[1]}$ This field has witnessed numerous contributions, exemplified in Figure 1a, encompassing nucleophilic substitutions with benzyl, allyl, or methyl halides as electrophiles (eq. i), and transition metal-promoted allylic alkylation via $\\pi -$ extended electrophiles or alkenes (eq. ii). An alternative pathway has been introduced by the Fu group, enabling the enantioconvergent coupling of racemic Reformatsky reagents with alkyl iodide (eq. iii) $.^{[2]}$ Conversely, the utilization of alkanes for a-alkylation via dehydrogenative crosscoupling (CDC) holds promise due to its inherent step economy and atom efficiency, achieved by the formal removal of two hydrogens during the process. $^{[3]}$ This process circumvents the need for preparing electrophilic precursors and the addition of base or metal reagents to promote enolization of less reactive carbonyls. Significant contributions have been made to CDC reactions, pioneered by Li's work, $^{[4]}$ enabling the cross-coupling of various partners with the assistance of oxidants and metal precursors (such as $Cu^{+}, \\space Fe^{2+},$ or $Pd^{0}).$ Remarkable progress has been achieved in the asymmetric catalytic cross-coupling of C(sp3)-H bonds adjacent to heteroatoms, $^{[5]}$ diaryl methane derivatives, $^{[6]}$ and allylic compounds, $^{[7]}$ using aldehydes or 1,3-dicarbonyls as partners (Figure 1a, iv). However, the exploration of simple alkanes with relatively strong bond strength, suitable for direct a-alkylation of prochiral enolates, remains a relatively uncharted area. The high energy required for C( $sp^{3})-H$ breaking and the transient, unfunctionalized nature of alkyl radicals, along with the Z/E geometry of enolate partners, make the control of diastereoand enantioselectivity the most challenging aspects of direct acyclic ester enolate alkylation reactions.\nIron, as one of the most abundant and nontoxic metals, is especially attractive and useful in cross-coupling reaction of simple alkanes and others. $^{[8]}$ The general process follows two routes as depicted in Figure 1b. Nevertheless, chiral iron complex catalyzed asymmetric oxidative coupling reaction remains vacant and arduous, partly due to the low reactivity, harsh reaction conditions and multiple elusive roles of iron species during the process. $^{[9]}$ Ligands play a pivotal role in altering the electronic configuration, related geometry, and redox capabilities of metal complex catalysts. $^{[10]}$ Amajority of $Fe^{2+}/Fe^{3+}$ complexes with six coordination numbers adopt an octahedral structure, indicating that these ferric or ferrous species can maintain distinct coordination geometries during the reaction if robust and multidentate ligands are involved. Moreover, molecular orbital arguments regarding the oxidation reactions of $Fe^{(II)}-Fe^{(III)}$ suggest that self-exchange rates are generally facile where electron transfer readily occurs between $t_{eg}$ orbitals. [11] Previously, our group introduced a type of tetra-oxygen chiral N,N'dioxides, and their metal complexes have demonstrated excellent performance as chiral Lewis acid catalysts for asymmetric polar- $couplings^{[12]}$ and others. $^{[13]}$ Intrigued by the attributes of N,N'-dioxides: a) tetra-dentate coordinative ability to form octahedral $Fe^{(II)}$ and $Fe^{(III)}$ species with stable $\\Delta -$ cis-a topology at iron centers; $^{[14]}b)$ status as a weak-field ligand that forms high-spin iron complexes compatible with oxidants, which are expected to undergo facile redox processes; c) various modulable substructures, we envision that chiral N,N'-dioxide-ferrous complexes hold promise for\n$R^{2}FG$\n$\\frac{L*/metalsalt}{\\text{oxidant}}$\nGF\nOrganocatalysis $R^{2}\\space + \\space R^{3}-$ LG $\\frac{\\text{Organocatalysis}}{\\text{or Photocatalysis}}\\space R^{1}\\underset{R^{3}}{\\overset{O}{\\bigstar}}$\n(iv)\nR1\n$R^{3}=$ allyl, benzyl, propargyl, CH2CO2R\nR.CHO\n$RO_{2}C \\space\\text{CO}_{2}R$\n$RO_{2}C \\space\\text{CO}_{2}R$\nAr\n$R^{1}R^{2}+R^{3}$ LG $\\frac{L^{*}/TM,base}{TM=Pd,Mo}$\nAr\nAr\nAr\nCHO\nR1\n10\nCozzi, $2009^{[14]}$\nCu(II/DDQ\nPd(II) $/O_{2}\\\\$ Xu, $2013^{[15b]}$\nCu(II)/DDQLiu,2021113]\n$R^{2}\\frac{1)NaDA}{2)ZnBr_{2}}[R^{\\parallel}R^{2}] \\frac{R^{3}-|}{L^{\\bigstar /Ni}}$ ,\n$\\circ$\n$R^{2}$\n$R^{3}$\n$\\circ$\nR\nR\nR\nA\nNaDA=sodium diisopropylamide\nOHC\nAr\nR\nR1\n$R^{2}$\nAr\nR1\nO Formation of enolates: use of base, Z/E geometry\n$Li,2007^{[4]}$\n2014\n2019\nFe(II)/DTBP\nO Alkylation reagents: prefunctionalization, less generallity\nPd(O)/DMBQ $Gong^{[16]}$\nOshima, $2018^{[25]}$\n(b) Profile of asymmetric catalytic CDC of $Csp^{3}-H$ bond of alkanes\n$R^{3}FG$\nSET\n$R^{3}$\nAr\n。\n$R^{2-}$\nR1\nR2-6\n$M^{n+1}$\nMn\n[OH]\nFe(OTf)2/L*\nR2\n$R^{3}$\nH\nHAA[O]\n[O]\nBuOOtBu\nAr\nR1\n$R^{3}$ FG\nR1\n0\nR\nR2\nR1\n$R^{1}=$ Ph,Bn,Me $R^{2},R^{3}=$ aryl,alkyl,allyl\n(this work)\n$R^{1}R^{2}$\n[OH]\n[O]\nMn\nGF\nO From simple alkanes with wide substrate generality:\n---alkylarens,allylic hydrocarbons and alkanes\nSET\nR2\n[OH]\nO Forming Z-enolates from acyclic carbonyls without addiitional base\nO $Fe^{2+}//Fe^{3+}$ catalyst in distinct octahedral geometries for SET process\nR1\nO\n$| \\leftarrow C-H$ bond activation $\\rightarrow | \\leftarrow C-C$ bond formation $\\rightarrow |$ OLMCT process enables radical-cross-coupling rather than polar coupling\nadvancing the asymmetric dehydrogenative a-alkylation of nonactivated alkanes.\nFor catalytic asymmetric a-alkylation, the use of acyclic carbonyl partners poses another long-standing challenge. $^{[15]}$ They should be well-coordinated with the chiral iron catalyst species to perform fast and Z/E-controllable enolization. Moreover, it is imperative to curb undesired homocoupling and a range of side reactions when adopting a radical-radical coupling pathway. Maintaining neutral conditions is essential to prevent racemization or epimerization. Previously. Ohshima, Yazaki and co-workers disclosed a chemoselective coupling of 2-acylimidazoles through dual iron catalyst activation. $^{[16]}$ The bidentate coordinative capability of 2acylimidazoles, extensively studied in radical alkylation by $Meggers^{[17]}$ and others , $^{[18]}$ combined with the polar effects of chiral iron complexes on the transition $state^{[19]}$ laid the foundation for our chiral iron-complex-enabled asymmetric dehydrogenative a-alkylation of 2-acylimidazoles with various nonactivated alkanes (Figure 1b). Herein, the highly stereoselective a-alkylation of 2-acylimidazoles with alkylarenes, allylic hydrocarbons and alkanes is achieved with moderate to good yields (up to 88 $\\%$ yield) and high ee values (up to 99 $\\%$ ee). Mechanistic study reveals an enantioselective radical-radical cross-coupling pathway following the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process of iron-(Z)-enolate intermediates.\nResults and Discussion\nReaction Development\nWe began our investigation using 2-acylimidazole as an enolate precursor and di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) as an oxidant (Table 1). In the presence of Fe(OTf) $_{2}, \\space N-$ methyl 2acylimidazole 1a' underwent CDC reaction to produce 3a'b in a mixture of toluene and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) at $80 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ (Table 1, entry 1, 18 $\\%$ yield). The combination of chiral N,N'-dioxides with Fe(OTf) $_{2}$ revealed that the CDC reaction could be accelerated with variation of the ligand backbones (Table 1, entries 2-4), especially the use of Lpipecolic acid-derived L- $PiiPr_{2}(3a'b, \\space 47 $\\%$$ yield, 27$\\%$ ee). Introducing a steric hindered and hydrophobic adamantyl group into the para-position of aniline unit of the ligand L- $PiPr_{2}$ Ad increased the enantioselectivity but lowered the yield (entry 5; 34 $\\%$ yield and 37 $\\%$ ee). It is interesting that N-aryl substituted 2-acylimidazole (1a\" and 1a) could further improve the enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 6 and 7) and the coupling of N-2,6-dimethylphenyl-bearing 2acylimidazole 1a with toluene gave the product 3ab in 53 $\\%$ee (entry 8). Furthermore, a prominent improvement on ee value (81 $\\%$ ee) was observed when reaction was carried out with 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TCE) instead of DCE (entry 9). The alkylation of ethylbenzene 2a with 2-acylimidazole 1a showed higher reactivity and stereocontrol in the presence\nof L- $PiPr_{2}$ Ad-Fe(OTf) $_{2}$ catalyst probably due to more stable benzylic radical, favouring the product 3aa in 53 $\\%$ yield. 7:3 dr and nearly identical enantioselectivity (93$\\%$ and 94$\\%$ ee) for each diastereomer (entry 10). Reducing the concentration of 2-acylimidazole via increasing the amount of solvent and ethylbenzene also benefitted the yield(entry 11,60$\\%$yield).10mol$\\%$ $Na_{2}SO_{4}$ wasaddedasa drying agent to help this transformation more repeatable. Fe(OTf) $_{3}$ worked in slightly inferior outcomes (entry 12) and $FeCl_{2}$ delivered racemic products (entry 13). Subjecting acylimidazole in batches further enhanced the yield to 70 $\\%$with maintained diastereo- and enantioselectivity (entry 14). In contrast to tetra-oxygen N,N'-dioxide ligands, the use of nitrogen-based bidentate Pybox-1 and tridentate Pybox-2. as well as classic Salen ligand gave poor reactivity and stereoselectivity (entries 15-17). Noteworthily, the loss of yield was mainly due to the formation of methylation byproduct 4 and cross-coupling product 5 with 1,1,2trichloroethane (See Supporting Information 12.5 for the proposed pathways).\nSubstrate Scope\nWith the optimal reaction parameters identified for the CDC approach, we then sought to explore the reaction of ethylbenzene with other 2-acylimidazoles 1 (Figure 2). Substituted (imidazol-2-yl)-2-phenylethanones were readily coupled with ethylbenzene to produce 3aa-3aj in good yield(52-85$\\%$) and high enantioselectivity (79-99 $\\%$ ee) for each diastereomer. Unfortunately, the dr value is hard to control owing to the lack of interaction between ethylbenzene and the chiral catalyst. 2-Naphthylmethyl, benzyl, methyl, and cyclohexyl-containing 2- acylimidazoles underwent the CDCs with ethylbenzene at the a-position to form the alkylation products (3ka-3 na) with moderate to good yield(59-80$\\%$) and excellent levels of enantioselectivity(8795.5$\\%$ ee), and the diastereoselectivity of benzyl based 3la reached at 9:1 as the best. The coupling of toluene with representative 2-acylimidazoles were also explored using L- $PiPr_{3}$ as the optimal ligand. These couplings were tolerable to afford the corresponding dialkyl substituted acylimidazoles (3 ab-3 pb) with moderate yield and slightly dropped ee values. Finally, a gram-scale reaction of 2-acylimidazole 1a with ethylbenzene 2 a was performed to probe the practicability, and comparable results were obtained. The absolute configuration of the major diastereomer 3aa was determined to be (2R,3S) by X-ray crystallography analysis. $^{[20]}$\nWe next evaluated the generality of the selective alkylation with respect to benzylic hydrocarbons and others(Figure 3). Substituted ethylbenzene derivatives proceeded the cross-couplings with 2-acylimidazole 1a well to give the two diastereomers (3ac,3ad,3aj-3an) in 57-88 $\\%$ yield and 88-98 $\\%$ ee; and 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene, propylbenzene, and cumene performed the reaction with lower yield but good enantioselectivity (3 ae-3 ag, up to 99 $\\%$ ee). The reaction of mesitylene and 1-methylnaphthalene gave 3ah and 3ai in dropped yields and lower ee values possibly caused by poor solubility of catalysts with excessive hydrocarbon. The heteroaryl groups could be introduced but the enantioselectivity decreased obviously (3ao and 3ap). It is interesting that these electron-rich aryls and heteroaryls devoted adverse effects on the enantioselectivity. The reactions of substituted toluenes with benzyl-substituted 2-acylimidazole 11 afforded somewhat better outcomes, furnishing dibenzyl substituted 3lq-3ls in 50-52 $\\%$ yield and 84-85 $\\%$ ee.2Phenylacetonitrile coupled with 1a to generate 3at in 60 $\\%$yield and 88:12 dr with 84 $\\%$ ee for the major diastereoisomer. 2,3-Dimethylbut-2-ene reacted with methyl substituted 2-\nacylimidazole 1m to form vinyl substituted product 3mu with higher outcome (74 $\\%$ yield with 85 $\\%$ ee) than the reaction of phenyl substituted 1a. (E)-methylstyrene, cyclopentene, and cycloheptene performed the CDC reactions at the allylic position, delivering the products 3mv-3mx with 42-74 $\\%$ yield and 76-86 $\\%$ ee. Moreover, the reaction was also compatible with cyclic alkenes, such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, and cyclooctane as well, which smoothly delivered the desired products (3 mh-3 mk) with moderate enantioselectivity after alteration of the ligand into L- $PiPr_{2}.$ We rationalize the decreased selectivity is due to conformational difference between benzyl radicals and cyclic alkyl radicals (planar $sp^{2}$ vs triangle $sp^{3}).$ The variable configurated of cyclic alkyl radicals enhances the difficulty in spatial discrimination.\nThe utility of the present iron catalysis was demonstrated by further elaboration of the 2-acylimidazole $functionality^{[17]}$ (Figure 4a). Upon treatment with MeOTf followed by the addition of MeOH and DBU, chiral carboxylate derivative 6 was obtained in high yield and enantioselectivity.\nMechanistic Consideration\nMechanistic experiments were carried out to trap possible intermediates and catalytic species during the process (Figure 4b and 4c). When (2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidin-1yl)oxyl (TEMPO) was subjected into the standard reaction system (Figure 4b), the TEMPO-trapping product 7A was isolated in 90 $\\%$ yield, suppressing the formation of the $\\alpha -$ alkylation process. The alkane-TEMPO coupling product 8 was detected via ESI-MS analysis. When excessive Fe(OTf) $_{3}$ was used instead of Fe(OTf) $_{2}/$ DTBP oxidative system, the related trap-products 7A and 8 could be detected but with decreased yield. Nevertheless, the addition of DMPO (2,2dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole-1-oxide) into the standard reaction system led to a mess of products; product 7B and ketone derivative 7C were identified from the oxidative reaction with one equivalent of Fe(OTf $)_{3}\\space($ Figure 4c). Moreover, a small amount of a-aryl coupling product 7D was isolated instead of the standard a-alkylation product 3aa, raising from the aryl group of ethylbenzene (Figure 4d). These experiments indicate the formation of iron-enolate\n$R^{2}$\n$\\xrightarrow{Fe(OTf)2/L-PiPr2Ad(1:1,10mol $\\%$),NaSO_{4}(10mol $\\%$)}$\nDTBP(2.8 equiv.),TCE, $80 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,N2,10-40h$\nAr=\nintermediate and the related radical for the coupling, there is a single electron transfer (SET) process from $Fe^{(III)}\\rightarrow Fe^{(II)}$ during the coupling step. In the presence of one equivalent of pure (2R,3R)-isomeric product 3aa, the reaction of methyl substituted 2-acylimidazole 1m with ethylbenzene was not affected (Figure 4e), indicating that the products formed did no harm to the reaction course and excluded the possibility of the product as an auxiliary ligand. $^{16}$ The optical activity of the recovered 3aa did not change, suggesting no further epimerization via enolization in the reaction system. Next, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments were carried out to probe into the rate-determining step. A competitive KIE study using a mixture of ethylbenzene $/d^{10}-$ ethylbenzene(Figure 4f, upper) and the two parallel reactions with only ethylbenzene 2a or $2a-d^{10}$ (Figure 4f, below) revealed a KIE value $(k_{H}/k_{D})$ as 2.67 and 2.17 respectively. When $d^{2}-$ acyl imidazole $1 \\space a-d^{2}$ was subjected into the reaction system, only $89 \\space $\\%$ \\space 1a-d^{2}$ and 55$\\%$ 3aa $-d^{1}$ were observed after 5 minutes(Figure 4g), probably owing to ready enolization and protonation, which demonstrated that the formation of enolate intermediate was not the rate-determining step of the CDC reaction.\nDFT calculations provided the configuration stability information of the enolate of 2-acyl imidazoles (Figure 5a) that the Z-type isomers are more stable than E-isomers, and N-aryl substitution slightly enhances the energy difference between the two isomers. In addition, perpendicular arrangement between the N-2,6-dimethylphenyl ring and the Z-enolate planar reduces the torsional strain and may create steric hindrance to contribute the the enantiocontrol.\nOn the basis of a series of mechanistic studies, a plausible catalytic cycle is depicted in Figure 5c. First, L*- $Fe^{(III)}$ species would generate from L- $PiPr_{2}$ Ad-Fe(OTf) $_{2}$ and DTBP through a Fenton-type reaction, accompanying the\ngeneration $of^{t}BuO^{-}$ species. The oxidation from L*- $Fe^{(II)}$ to L*- $Fe^{(III)}$ might readily occur since the calculated standard redox potential drops dramatically with coordination of N,N'-dioxide \\{with respect to SHE: [L*- $Fe^{(III)}$ (OTf) $_{2}/$ L*- $Fe^{(II)}$ (OTf) $_{2}]=-0.3$ eV vs $Fe^{(III)}$ (OTf) $_{2}(H_{2}O)_{4}/Fe^{(II)}($ OTf) $_{2}-$ $(H_{2}O)_{4}\\}=1.4$ eV\\} (See Supporting Information 13 for details). 2-Acylimidazole (1a) proceeds deprotonation and enolization at the assistance of BuO- anion, generating the intermediate A upon coordination to the iron species. A ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process [L*- $Fe^{(III)}-$ enolate $] \\space A \\leftrightarrows [L*-Fe^{(II)}-a-$ keto alkyl radical] A' likely occur. At the same time, benzyl C--H bond cleavage ( $PhCH_{2}-H:$ BDE $=89.8 \\pm 0.6$ kcal/mol) is achieved by tert-butoxy radical $(^{t}$ BuO-H: BDE $=105.7 \\pm 0.7$ kcal/mol) to give the alkyl radical B.\nMoreover, we performed DFT calculations to gain insights into the electronic properties of the complex A(Figure 5c). First, the ground state of A(A') is calculated to be a sextet. Second, spin density on a-carbon atom is with spin population of 0.34 besides the iron center. This indicates that the process of LMCT takes place when enolate binds to the iron center, resulting a carbon radical species A' which is in agreement with the radical trapping experiments. Third, substituent effect on the carbon radical has been examined. Replacement of the phenyl group of the enolate by 4-F-phenyl (spin population=0.33) or Me (spin population=0.3) does not alter the radical character of A'(see Supporting Information 13 for details). Moreover, the reaction of A' and benzyl radical was examined as well(Figure 5d). A van der walls intermediate was identified along the radical approaching A'. The radical coupling to the Re face of the enolate (radical) is more favorable of 1.1 kcal/mol in energy higher than the Si face. This is due to the steric repulsion between the radical and the substitute on the amide moiety of the N,N'-dioxide ligand.\nConclusion\nWe report the development of enantioselective a-alkylation of acyclic 2-acylimidazoles via dehydrogenative cross-coupling of hydrocarbons achieved through a highly efficient catalytic platform featuring readily accessible and adjustable N,N-dioxide-Fe(OTf) $_{2}$ catalysts. This approach enables the activation of inert C( $sp^{3})-H$ bonds in a diverse range of benzylic, allylic hydrocarbons, and nonactivated alkanes, all with impressive stereoselectivity (up to 99 $\\%$ ee). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward avenue for optically active compounds, starting from the most basic materials with minimal steps and waste generation. Mechanistic insights indicate a radical-radical cross-coupling pathway facilitated by the interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species. Further applications of this type of non-precious transition metal complexes for asymmetric oxidation and others are undergoing.\nAcknowledgements\nWe appreciate the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22188101), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFA1504301), and Sichuan University (2020SCUNL204) for financial support.

However, previous studies are mainly limited to the metallic/semiconducting ones as contact/channel materials, but very few are related to the insulating dielectrics. Here, we use a facile one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to synthesize ultrathin $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ dielectric alloys, whose composition is tunable over the full range of x just by changing the relative ratios of the $GeO_{2}/ SiO_{2}$ precursors. Moreover, their dielectric properties are highly composition-tunable, showing a record-high dielectric constant of>40 among CVD-grown 2D insulators. The vertically grown nature of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ and $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ enables polymer-free transfer and subsequent clean van der Waals integration as the high-k encapsulation layer to enhance the mobility of 2D semiconductors. Besides, the $MoS_{2}$ transistors using $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloy as gate dielectrics exhibit a large $I_{on}/I_{off}(>10^{8}),$ ideal subthreshold swing of $\\sim 61$ mV/decade, and a small gate hysteresis $(\\sim 5$ mV). Our work not only gives very few examples on controlled CVD growth of insulating dielectric alloys but also expands the family of 2D single-crystalline high-k dielectrics.\nINTRODUCTION\nTwo-dimensional (2D) alloys, which are formed by mixing two or more similar constituent phases together, have attracted considerable attention in wide research fields, such as electronics, $^{1-3}$ thermoelectricity, $^{4}$ and catalysis. Compared to 2D materials with a fixed composition, the compositionvaried alloys allow their physical properties to be continuously modulated to an on-demand state. To this end, a series of 2D alloys have been successfully synthesized with the purpose of band gap engineering and removal of contact issues. $^{2,6-11}$ For example, Duan et al. recently reported that the 2D metallic alloy of $VS_{2x}Se_{2(1-x)}$ with composition-tunable work functions can be used to engineer metal-semiconductor contacts.1 Those studies thoroughly illustrated the advantages of using 2D alloys as elementary components of 2D transistors to enhance their electrical performance. However, when we take a close look at the electrical conductivities of as-synthesized 2D alloys, we found that previous studies are mainly limited to the metallic and semiconducting alloys as contact electrodes and channel materials, but very few are related to insulating dielectrics.\nThanks to the advantages of enhancing the carrier mobility and reducing gate hysteresis of 2D transistors, $^{12-19}$ avariety of van der Waals (vdW) single-crystalline 2D insulators with high-k nature are identified as the gate dielectrics to fabricate high-performance devices, including $CaF_{2}(\\varepsilon _{r}=8.4),^{20}Bi_{2}SeO_{5}$ $(\\varepsilon _{r}=15.6),^{21}$ VOCl $(\\varepsilon _{r}=11.7),^{22}$ LaOCl $(\\varepsilon _{r}=10.8),^{23}$ and $ZrO_{2}(\\varepsilon _{r}=8-19).^{24}$ Even so, the reported 2D insulators that meet the requirements to form uniform solid solutions are still rare, since the formation of insulating dielectric alloys usually needs a mixture of two or more constituent phases with similar physicochemical properties and crystal structures. Very recently, we achieved the vertical growth of a wide-gap highk 2D insulator of $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ on various substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which can serve as excellent vdW gate dielectrics and screening layers for promoting the device performance. $^{18}$ Substitution of Ge for Si in the $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ can form the isostructural $Bi_{2}GeO_{5},^{25}$ which is predicted to have a higher dielectric constant $(>40)^{26,27}$ but a smaller band gap $(\\sim 3.35-3.50 \\space eV)^{28,29}$ than $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}.$ However, the studies on $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ are limited to very few regarding their powder/bulk crystals as $photocatalysis^{28,29}$ and high-temperature dielectric ceramics. $^{26}$ There are no reports on the CVD growth of ultrathin $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ film yet. Theoretically speaking, alloying the $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ with the similar $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ is highly desirable, since it\nACS Publications\n11523\nArticle\noffers an effective strategy to continuously regulate its dielectric properties, such as dielectric constant and breakdown field strength, for specific applications.\nHere, for the first time, we successfully synthesized an ultrathin dielectric alloy of $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ by a facile one-step CVD method, whose composition allows continuous regulation from x=0 (pure $Bi_{2}GeO_{5})$ to x=1 (pure $Bi_{2}SiO_{5})$ by adjusting the proportion of two raw materials ( $GeO_{2}+ SiO_{2})$ in the reaction. Moreover, as the composition changes, the dielectric constant of the alloy can be gradually modulated from $28.6 \\space \\pm \\space 1.5$ to $39.4 \\space \\pm \\space 1.1,$ and the breakdown field strength varies from 2.6 to 6.3 MV/cm. Unlike other 2D insulators, the as-synthesized $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloy can be vertically grown on the mica substrate, showing great feasibility of sample transfer by polymer-free mechanical pressing and subsequent vdW integration with 2D semiconductors via layerby-layer stacking. Thanks to its ultrahigh-k nature and dangling-bond-free ultraflat surface, the CVD-grown $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ and alloy nanosheets were demonstrated as excellent h-BN-like encapsulation layers to improve the mobility of few-layer $MoS_{2}$ $(\\sim 300 $\\%$$ at 50 K) and high-k dielectric layers to fabricate lowpower, hysteresis-free $MoS_{2}$ field-effect transistors (FETs).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe alloys are formed by mixing two or more compounds with similar physicochemical properties and crystal structures to avoid possible phase segregations. Typically, continuously regulating the composition of the alloys over the full range requires us to achieve the separate growth of the pure phases(alloy precursors) first. Very recently, we have achieved the CVD growth of free-standing $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ nanosheets on mica by a method using $BiF_{3}+ SiO_{2}$ as the precursors. Similar to $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ , $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ crystallizes in the Aurivillius-type layered structure with positively charged [ $Bi_{2}O_{2}]$ layers and negatively charged[ $GeO_{3}]$ layers alternatively stacked along the a axis (Figure 1a). Owing to the larger atomic radius of Ge than Si, $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ has slightly expanded lattice parameters (a=15.68 A,b=5.49 $A, \\space c=5.38 \\space A, \\space \\beta =90.01^{\\circ})$ than $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}\\space(a=15.12 \\space \\dot{A}, \\space b=5.44$ $A,c=5.29 \\space A, \\beta =90.07^{\\circ}).$ The structural similarity makes it possible to synthesize $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ under a synthetic condition similar to the one of $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}.$\nAs shown in Figure 1b, the pure phase of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ was grown by a similar CVD method with $BiF_{3}+ GeO_{2}$ acting as the reactive materials. The $BiF_{3}$ powders were placed on top of the $GeO_{2}$ powders in a quartz boat located in the heating\n11524\nArticle\ncenter, and the freshly cleaved fluorophlogopite mica substrates were placed above the quartz boat. Similar to $SiO_{2}$ , $GeO_{2}$ also has a high melting point and can react with the fluoride to form volatile products, such as gaseous $GeF_{4}$ with a boiling point of $-36.5 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ thus driving the chemical equilibrium to form the phase of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}.$ Figure 1c presented the typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of asgrown 2D $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ crystals on a mica substrate, showing a similar CVD growth phenomenon with previously reported $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}^{18}$ and $Bi_{2}O_{2}Se^{30,31}$ that the vertically grown samples coexist with the in-plane grown ones. Besides, we observed similar CVD growth results on glass and sapphire substrates(Figure S1). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography(Figure 1d) shows a representative $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanoplate on mica with a thickness of 4.0 nm and an atomically flat surface. Similarly, the vertically grown $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ can be easily transferred to other substrates by a facile polymer-free method of mechanical pressing (Figure 1e). A typical optical microscope (OM) image (Figure 1f) shows that the astransferred $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheets exhibit irregular shapes, with lateral dimensions ranging from a few to tens of micrometers. As different color contrasts correspond to different thicknesses of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ on the $SiO_{2}/$ Si substrate, it enables the quick selection of objective crystals with well-defined thickness by OM imaging. Importantly, unlike the polymer-assisted transfer process, a 12.5-nm-thick $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheet transferred by mechanical pressing remains an atomically flat surface over the whole domain without any organic pollutants and wrinkles(Figure 1g). Moreover, measuring the step height of a terraced $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheet can determine the layer spacing of a layered material. As a result, a step height of $\\sim 0.78$ nm was measured by AFM, which is consistent with the theoretical value of monolayer $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ (Figure S2). Besides, the CVDgrown $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheets display excellent air and thermal stability, whose surface morphology and roughness remain almost the same even when exposed to air for more than 90 days or annealing at $400 \\space ^{\\circ}C$ in the air for 10 min (Figures S2S4).\nThe vertically grown samples were transferred onto a Cu grid or sapphire substrate to determine the elemental compositions by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), showing uniform elemental distributions and an atomic ratio of Bi/Ge close to 2:1 (Figure 1h and Figure S5). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further performed to examine\n11525\nArticle\nthe microstructure and quality of the as-grown $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheets. As shown in Figure li-l and Figure S6, we performed high-resolution TEM imaging along four zone axes of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ ,namely,(001),(010),(011),and(100),all of which match well with the theoretical projected model and lattice spacing of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}.$ Based on the atomic-resolved crosssectional TEM technique, the alternative stacking of[ $Bi_{2}O_{2}]_{n}^{2n+}$ and [ $GeO_{3}]_{n}^{2n-}$ layers with a layer space of 0.795 nm was observed, and the measured lattice spacings of 0.557,0.275,and 0.384 nm can be ascribed to the lattice planes of(110),(002),and $(11 \\overline{1})$ ,respectively.Additionally,the sharp X-ray diffraction(XRD) peaks of as-transferred $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ can be fully indexed as (h00) planes of $Bi_{2}GeO_{s},$ further confirming the high crystallinity and phase purity of the CVDgrown samples (Figure S7). The electron affinity and band gap are important for utilizing $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ as a dielectric in FETs. The optical band gap of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ is measured to be $\\sim 3.3$ eV by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Figure S8),which is in good agreement with the theoretically calculated value $(\\sim 3.4$ eV, Figure S9), cathodoluminescence(CL) spectra result $(\\sim 3.2$ eV, Figure S10), and the reported value of 3.35-3.50 eV. $^{28,29}$ Thereafter, we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to determine the electron affinity of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}.$ From the UPS data, we can deduce the energy positions of the valence band maximum(VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) as -6.71 eV and -3.31 eV, respectively. Thus, the electron affinity of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ is extracted as 3.31 eV (Figure S11).\nThe separate growth of the pure phases of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ and $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ under similar synthetic conditions makes it possible to grow $Bi_{2}$ Ge(Si) $O_{5}$ alloys with tunable compositions. Here, the $SiO_{2}$ and $GeO_{2}$ powders with different ratios are mechanically ground together (Figure 2a), with $BiF_{3}$ powders on top of the mixed powders instead. As shown in Figure 2b, the growth behavior of $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloys is almost the same as the pure phase of $Bi_{2}GeO_{j},$ showing the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane growth modes on the mica substrate. Moreover, the as-synthesized ultrathin alloy nanosheets are also atomically flat without any surface contamination (Figure 2c). The SEM image and corresponding elemental maps (Bi, Si, and Ge) revealed the uniform distribution of related elements. It is worth noting that the SEM-EDS maps were performed on the sapphire substrate to exclude the interference of Si from the mica substrate. The x value in $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ was determined by averaging the EDS analysis on 10 samples transferred onto sapphire substrates, and the error bars represent the corresponding standard deviations. Based on quantitative analysis of the Ge and Si elements in 10 randomly distributed alloy nanosheets, the x value in the specific alloy nanosheets(Figures 2b, c, and d) synthesized by using a mixed powder of $SiO_{2}/$ ( $SiO_{2}+ GeO_{2})=0.2$ can be determined as $\\sim 0.278.$ To further confirm the successful synthesis of a novel quaternary compound, the alloy nanosheets transferred to the sapphire\n11526\nArticle\nwere characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), which simultaneously shows the obvious signals of Bi 4f, Si 2p, and Ge 3d (Figure S12). More importantly, we found that tuning the chemical composition of alloy nanosheets is possible by adjusting the precursor compositions, showing a near-linear relation between the precursor and final alloy compositions (Figure 2e). Besides, the XRD peaks of assynthesized $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ obey Vegard's law, with the (h00) peaks shifted to a larger $2 \\theta$ value as the x value in $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ increases (Figure S13). In other words, the x value in $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloys is continuously tunable from x=0 (pure $Bi_{2}GeO_{5})$ to a composition-varied alloy to x=1 (pure $Bi_{2}SiO_{5})$ with the precursor composition changes. To further confirm the successful composition tuning of $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ nanosheets with high uniformity, we performed cross-sectional TEM to characterize the vertical direction of elemental distribution and atomic microstructure. Here, two representative alloys were chosen. The one with the Si/(Si+Ge)=0.654 is represented as the Si-rich one, and the one with the Si/(Si +Ge)=0.278 is named as the Ge-rich alloy. As shown in Figure 2f and Figure S14, both the Si-rich and Ge-rich samples showed uniform elemental distributions for the elements of Bi, Ge, and Si, and the interfaces between different layers are also very sharp. Thus, the uniform elemental distribution is realized not only in the in-plane EDS maps but also in the vertical direction, suggesting the successful growth of 2D dielectric alloys. In addition, the atomically resolved high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique was used to see the microstructure of the alloy. It is well-known that the image contrast in an HAADF-STEM image is proportional to the Z atomic number of the elements $(\\sim Z^{1.6-1.7}).$ Based on the contrast difference in Figure 2g and h, it can clearly distinguish the Bi-O layers from the Si/Ge-O layers. More specifically, there are clear contrast differences in the [ $Si_{x}Ge_{1-x}O_{3}]_{n}^{2n-}$ layers between the Si-rich and Ge-rich alloys, signifying the random atomic replacement between the heavier Ge and lighter Si to form an alloy. Furthermore, the lattice spacings of (200) planes were measured as 7.71 A for the Si-rich sample (x = 0.654) and 7.85 A for the Ge-rich sample (x=0.278), representing a slight decrease in interplanar spacing with increasing x.\nDielectric constant and breakdown field strength are two of the most important parameters of a dielectric material. $^{32,33}$ Here, we evaluated the related dielectric properties of the pristine and Si-alloyed $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheets by vdW integration to construct the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor on the quartz substrate. As shown in Figure 3a, the thermally evaporated ultraflat Pd film (10 nm) and In/Au (5/40 nm) metals serve as the bottom and top electrodes. Due to the high-k nature and polymer-free vdW integration process, the capacitance density of a $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanoflake with a thickness of 37.8 nm can reach a very high value of $1.0 \\space \\mu F/cm^{2}$ at 100 Hz and merely changes with frequency varying from 100 Hz to 1\nArticle\nMHz (Figure 3b). The dielectric constant $(\\varepsilon _{r})$ of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ was calculated as 42.5 by the equation\n$$\\varepsilon _{r}= \\frac{Cd}{A \\varepsilon _{o}}$$\n(1)\nin which C is the measured capacitance, $\\varepsilon _{o}$ is the vacuum permittivity, d is the thickness of the $Bi_{2}GeO_{5},$ and A is the effective area (the overlap between top and bottom electrodes) of the MIM device $(\\sim 112 \\space \\mu m^{\\frac{1}{2}}).$ The corresponding frequency-dependent capacitance (C-f, Figure 3c) characteristic of the device shows the similar tendency to the C-V data. Furthermore, we examined whether the dielectric properties of the alloy are composition-tunable by comparing the dielectric constant and breakdown behavior of pure $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ to those of the $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloy and pure $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}.$ Interestingly, the $\\varepsilon _{r}$ value of the three different $Bi_{2}Si_{0.278}$ alloy nanosheets is averaged to be $35.7 \\pm 1.5$ at the frequency of 1.0 MHz(Figure 3d), which locates within the range of the pure $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}(39.4 \\pm 1.1)$ and $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}(28.6 \\pm 1.5).$ Besides, the leakage current and corresponding breakdown field strength of $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ , $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ ,and $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ with similar thicknesses(23.4/22.9/20.6 nm) were compared in Figure 3e, showing tunable breakdown field strength ranging from 2.6 to 6.3 MV/cm below the low-power limit (0.015 $Acm^{-2}).$ The observed composition-varied dielectric constants and breakdown field strength are consistent with the fact that $Bi_{2}SiO_{5}$ has a larger band gap but lower dielectric constant than $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}.$ To illustrate the superior high-K characteristic of the BiGe(Si) $O_{5}$ dielectric alloy, we benchmark the value with the reported representative vdW dielectrics. $^{15,18,20-24,34-42}$ As shown in Figure 3f, the $\\varepsilon _{r}$ of >40 in $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ is almost the highest value among CVD-grown 2D single-crystalline insulators (exemplified by $\\varepsilon _{r}=3.3$ for h- $BN^{42}$ and $\\varepsilon _{r}=10.8$ for $LaOCl^{23})$ and is apparently higher than the commercial atomic-layer-deposited(ALD) high-k dielectrics, such as $HfO_{2}\\space(\\varepsilon _{r}\\approx \\space 16)$ and $Al_{2}O_{3}$ $(\\varepsilon _{r}\\approx 9).$\nOne of the most well-known functions for a high-k singlecrystalline dielectric is acting as the h-BN-like vdW encapsulation layer to enhance the carrier mobility of 2D materials. $^{17,21}$ Benefiting from weak interactions between the vertically grown $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ and the mica substrate, we can easily fabricate complex vdW heterojunction devices via layer-bylayer stacking. Figure 4a shows the schematic of a back-gated $MoS_{2}$ Hall device with double encapsulation layers of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}.$ Here, the mechanically exfoliated graphene serves as the bottom-gate electrode, and the bottom layer of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ acts as the gate dielectric to modulate the carrier density of the $MoS_{2}$ channel. To avoid the influence of sample quality variation, we performed Hall measurements twice on the same MoS2 Hallbar device just before and after placing the top encapsulation layer of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ (Figure 4b). Prior to evaluating the role of the top encapsulation layer, we carried out gated Hall measurements to extract the capacitance density $(C_{ox})$ of the bottom $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ layer. Figure 4c shows Hall resistance $(R_{xy})$ as a function of the magnetic field (B) under various gate voltages $(V_{g})$ at 300 K, from which we can extract the $V_{g}-$ dependent sheet carrier densities $(n_{2D}).$ By extracting the slope of the linear $n_{2D}-V_{g}$ curve, which equals $C_{ox}/e(e$ is the elementary charge), the $C_{ox}$ for a 24.2-nm-thick $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ is derived as high as $1.5 \\space \\mu F/cm^{2},$ and its dielectric constant can be as high as $\\sim 40.8.$ The extracted $\\varepsilon _{r}$ by gated Hall measurements is consistent with the MIM results (Figure 3b).\nAfter the first-round Hall measurements, the top encapsulation layer of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ was capped on the device to study its influence on the device performance. First, we compared the temperature-dependent longitudinal resistance $(R_{xx}-T)$ behavior of the same $MoS_{2}$ device before and after top-layer encapsulation at $V_{g}=0 \\space V.$ Interestingly, the channel resistance\n11528\nArticle\n$(R_{xx})$ of the $MoS_{2}$ device with a top encapsulation layer is lower than the one without a top encapsulation layer over the entire temperature range. Moreover, the $MoS_{2}$ device without the top encapsulation layer exhibited an upturn of $R_{xx}$ in the low-temperature region, while the one with the top encapsulation layer showed a monotonic decrease of $R_{xx}$ upon cooling. This phenomenon can be well understood that the double encapsulation of $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ reduced the interfacial scattering of charge impurities, as confirmed by the higher carrier mobility when sweeping the gate voltage from 0 to 1.6 V at low temperature (Figure 4f). Particularly, the mobility of top encapsulated $MoS_{2}$ is as high as $\\sim 626.9cm^{2}V^{-1}\\space s^{-1},$ which is about 3 times higher than the value of $MoS_{2}$ without top encapsulation $(\\sim 185.3cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1})atV_{g}=0V$ (Figure4g). The encapsulation by $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ improving the mobility of $MoS_{2}$ may be ascribed to the suppressed charge impurity scattering (such as surface adsorbents of $H_{2}O/O_{2})$ and enhanced dielectric/carrier screening effects. $^{43-45}$ The carrier mobility of $MoS_{2}$ with and without $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ top encapsulation showed different temperature dependences. For top-encapsulated $MoS_{2},$ its carrier mobility increased monotonically upon cooling down to 50 K. In contrast, the mobility of the nonencapsulated $MoS_{2}$ device showed a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, which fits well with the observed upturn of channel resistance in Figure 4e.\nThe vertically grown $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloy nanosheets were functionalized as high-k gate dielectrics of few-layer $MoS_{2}$ FETs. Figure 5a shows the schematic diagram of a top-gated $MoS_{2}$ FET with a $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ alloy nanosheet as the gate dielectric, which is fabricated on a $SiO_{2}/$ Si substrate by precise transfer and subsequent one-step deposition of source, drain, and top gate electrodes of In/Au. The hysteresisfree dual-sweep transfer curves and corresponding output curves of a $Bi_{2}Si_{x}MoS_{2}$ FET are plotted in Figure 5b and c, respectively. Thanks to the excellent gate tunability, the $Bi_{2}Si_{x}MoS_{2}$ FET can be effectively turned on and off when sweeping the gate voltage from +1 V to -1.0 V, showing a large $I_{on}/I_{off}$ of $>10^{7}$ and a low gate leakage current of $10^{-13}-$ $10^{-14}\\space A.$ Importantly, the transfer curves under different $V_{ds}$ steadily show an ultralow subthreshold swing (SS) of $\\sim 61$ mV/decade and low drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) of $\\sim 5$ mV/V(FigureS15),demonstratingthehighlyefficient tunability by using $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ as a gate dielectric. Furthermore, we investigated the gate hysteresis of the FET under different $V_{g}$ sweeping ranges (Figure 5d,f) and sweeping rates (Figure 5e,g). The gate hysteresis almost shows no change at different sweeping ranges $(\\sim 5.0$ mV for a sweeping range of 2.1 V; Figure 5f). Moreover, the gate hysteresis only increases slightly from 4.2 to 6.2 mV while lowering the sweeping rate from $0.25 \\space V \\space s^{-1}$ to $0.025 \\space V \\space s^{-1}$ (Figure 5e,g). The ultralow gate hysteresis suggests that a perfect vdW interface is formed between the alloy dielectric and $MoS_{2}.$ The interface trap density $D_{it}$ could be estimated using the following equation:\n$$SS= \\ln(10)\\frac{k_{B}T}{q}(1+ \\frac{qD_{it}}{C_{ox}})$$\n(2)\nwhere $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and $C_{ox}$ is the gate capacitance obtained from MOS capacitance measurements. The extracted $D_{it}$ is about $2.72 \\times 10^{11}cm^{-2}/$ eV, illustrating the formed clean and high-quality vdW interface.\nThe intrinsic $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}-$ gated $MoS_{2}$ FET also shows a high device performance (Figure S16). In addition, 2D $Bi_{2}O_{2}$ Sebased FETs using $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ as gate dielectric also show a high current on/off ratio $(I_{on}/I_{off}>10^{8}$ at $V_{ds}=0.1 \\space V),$ low gate leakage current $(<10^{-6}Acm^{-2}),$ and a low SS value $(\\sim 82$ mV/decade). It is worth noting that the gate hysteresis for the $Bi_{2}O_{2}$ Se/ $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ FET can be as small as $\\sim 11$ mV, which is almost the lowest value among $Bi_{2}O_{2}$ Se-based FETs (Figure S17).\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, our work reported the first CVD growth of 2D single-crystalline dielectric alloys. By changing the relative composition of the mixed powder precursors ( $GeO_{2}+ SiO_{2})$ , the composition of the $Bi_{2}Si_{x}$ dielectric alloys is highly tunable over the full range of x from x=0 to x=1. The composition-varied high-k nature and easy-transfer characteristic make the ultrathin pristine and Si-alloyed $Bi_{2}GeO_{5}$ nanosheets highly attractive as h-BN-like vdW encapsulation/dielectric layers to fabricate hysteresis-free devices operated at scaled voltages and to investigate exotic physical phenomena.\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c02496.\nExperimental details and supplementary figures (PDF)\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Author\nJinxiong Wu-Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China; $\\mathring{D}$ orcid.org/00000002-0286-1213;Email:jxwu@nankai.edu.cn\nAuthors\nJiabiao Chen - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nZhaochao Liu - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nZunxian Lv - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nYameng Hou - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nXiang Chen - Ultrafast Electron Microscopy Laboratory, The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak-Light Nonlinear Photonics, School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China\nLan Lan - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nTong-Huai Cheng - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary\n11529\nArticle\nScience Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nLei Zhang - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nYingnan Duan - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nHuixia Fu - Center of Quantum Materials and Devices \\&College of Physics, Chongqing University, Chongqing 401331, China\nXuewen Fu - Ultrafast Electron Microscopy Laboratory, The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak-Light Nonlinear Photonics, School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China; D orcid.org/0000-0001-6116-4680\nFeng Luo - Tianjin Key Lab for Rare Earth Materials and Applications, Smart Sensor Interdisciplinary Science Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China\nComplete contact information is available at:\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/jacs.4c02496\nNotes\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.92064005), the Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure (SKL202211SIC), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant No. 2023CDJXY-048).

However, the design and synthesis of high-performance materials face challenges due to the limited availability of specific ligands and pore structures. In this study, we have employed a novel highly branched $D_{3h}$ symmetrical planar conjugated ligand, dodechydroxylhexabenzotrinaphthylene(DHHBTN) to fabricate a series of 2D conductive MOFs, named M-DHHBTN (M=Co, Ni, and Cu). This new family of MOFs offers two distinct types of pores, elevating the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs to a more advanced level. The intricate tessellation patterns of the M-DHHBTN are elucidated through comprehensive analyses involving powder Xray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopic measurements unveiled carrier mobility in DHHBTNbased 2D MOFs spanning from 0.69 to 3.10 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}.$ Among MDHHBTN famility, Cu-DHHBTN displayed high electrical conductivity reaching 0.21 S $cm^{-1}$ at 298 K with thermal activation behavior. This work leverages the \"branched conjugation\" of the ligand to encode heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, underscoring the significant potential of heterogeneous double-pore structures for future applications.\nIntroduction\nOver the past decade, there has been a remarkable surge in the fascination surrounding two-dimensional (2D) electrically conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) $.^{[1]}$ This extraordinary kind of material is constructed by connecting $\\pi -$ conjugated organic building blocks with metal ions to form $d- \\pi$ extended layered structure, offering high surface areas and electrical conductivity. $^{[1b,2]}$ The elegant combination of electrical conductivity and porosity makes them particularly attractive for a wide range of applications, ranging from electrochemical energy storage,[3] electrochemical catalysts,[4] to chemiresistive sensors[5], and others. $^{[10,6]}$ Another compelling feature of conductive MOFs lies in their inherent tunability stemming from a wide range of potentially accessible organic building blocks with diverse configurations[7] and feasible functionalization of organic fragments, which makes conductive MOFs highly adaptable for various applications.\nDespite significant progress in the development of 2D conductive MOFs, the topological structures of 2D conductive MOFs remain restricted to simple tessellation patterns, which are often dominated by a single geometric shape with homogeneous porosities, such as hexagons or tetragons (Figure $1a-1c).^{[8]}$ This limitation often arises from the increased challenge of integrating different types of pores into the same framework.[9] So far, heterogeneous pore 2D frameworks have been developed using multiple-linking-site, $^{[10]}$ desymmetrization, $^{[11]}$ and self-carrying pore[12] strategies in organic ligand design. These innovative approaches enable the creation of MOFs with diverse and irregular pore structures, expanding their potential applications. For instance, leveraging the capability to independently modify and functionalize different types of pores within conductive MOFs allows for the introduction of distinct functions into each pore\nvariety for integrated functions, enabling the development of highly versatile and multifunctional active sites for energy storage, catalysis, sensing, and other fields. [13] However, at present, the availability of 2D MOFs with both high conductivity and heteropores is considerably limited. The primary challenge for the construction of heteroporous 2D conductive MOFs lies in the synthesis and utilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ligands that can meet the size and geometry requirement for generating $heteropores^{[14]}$ meanwhile ensuring highly feasible electron conduction pathways.\nTo tackle this challenge, here we have developed a new planar conjugated ligand, 2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17,22,23,26,27dodechydroxylhexabenzo[a,c,k,m,u,w]trinaphthylene(DHHBTN), in which three triphenylene units are fused to form a $D_{3h}$ symmetric, dodecatopic, and branched organic building block. With this unique $\\pi -$ extended ligand, we have successfully constructed three DHHBTN-based 2D MOFs, denoted as MDHHBTN (M=Co, Ni, and Cu), by linking DHHBTN with Co, Ni, and Cu ions, respectively. M-DHHBTN MOFs possess a unique ring-in-ring topology that allows the formation of hexagonal and rectangular pores simultaneously (Figure 1d). M-DHHBTN MOFs demonstrate metal node-dependent conductivity, among which Cu-DHHBTN exhibits an exceptional room temperature conductivity of 0.21 S cm-1. This value is the highest among heteroporous 2D MOFs and is even comparable to the hexaaminobenzene and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylenebased 2D conjugated MOFs. $^{[15]}$ Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic structure of DHHBTN-MOFs reveal metallic properties in the out-of-plane direction. Optical-pump terahertz-probe (OPTP) photoconductivity reveals a Drude-Smith type charge transport behavior with room temperature mobilities of 1.17,0.69, and 3.10 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ for Co-, Ni-, and Cu-DHHBTN. respectively. Dynamic study by OPTP and fs transient absorption spectra (fs-TA) elucidates the varied dynamics of photoinduced carriers of M-DHHBTN MOFs, in which Cu-DHHBTN is most favored for achieving high photoconductivity. As far as we know, M-DHHBTN MOF family we developed represents the first example simultaneously achieving high electron conductivity and a heterogeneous dual-pore structure in 2D MOFs.\nResults and Discussion\nSynthesis of M-DHHBTN MOFs\nThe DHHBTN ligand was synthesized starting from 2,3,6,7,10,11hexabromotriphenylene through a series of reactions, including Suzuki coupling reaction, Scholl reaction, and subsequent dealkylation reaction (Scheme $S1).^{[16]}$ The synthesized ligand DHHBTN was thoroughly characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figures S1-S5) and highresolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). The M-DHHBTN MOFs were prepared under similar solvothermal conditions (Scheme 1). Specifically, Co-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN were synthesized through the coordination polymerization between DHHBTN and the corresponding divalent metal salts in a mixture of Nmethylpyrrolidone and deionized water in a ratio of 1:3 (v/v) at $85 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 1 day, which gave the product as brownish-black and black powder, respectively (Scheme S2-S3). Cu-DHHBTN was made by reacting DHHBTN with the copper(II) trifluoroacetylacetonate, which yielded the desired product as a greenish-black powder (Scheme S4).\nStructural characterizations\nThe successful construction of the three DHHBTN-based MOFs was firstly confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). In the PXRD patterns of Co-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN (Figure 2a), prominent diffraction peaks are observed at $2 \\theta =3.3^{\\circ},5.8^{\\circ}.$ $8.8^{\\circ},10.0^{\\circ}$ and $12.1^{\\circ},$ which are corresponding to the (100),(110),(210),(300),and (310) lattice planes, respectively. Similarly, CuDHHBTN shows strong diffraction peaks at $3.6^{\\circ},62^{\\circ},9.0^{\\circ},10.5^{\\circ}$ , and $12.5^{\\circ}$ (Figure 2a). The observation of these sharp and intensive diffractions from the facets perpendicular to the ab plane demonstrates the good long-range periodicity along the ab plane in the three DHHBTN-MOFs. In comparison, the diffractions from the (001) facet, which is parallel to the ab plane, show relatively broader peaks at $25.4^{\\circ},25.4^{\\circ}$ ,and $24.7^{\\circ}$ for Co-, Ni-, and CuDHHBTN, respectively, indicating a decreased out-of-plane order. Pawley refinements against the experimental PXRD pattern of Co-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN reach fairly good agreement and generate unit cells in P6/MMM space group with parameters of a=b=30.15A,c=3.43 A for Co-DHHBTN and a=b=30.21A,c= 3.43 A for Ni-DHHBTN, respectively (Figure 2b). Correspondingly, cell parameters of a=29.73A,b=30.04 A, and c=3.47 A result in the best fit for the experimental PXRD pattern of Cu-DHHBTN (see section 3 in Supporting Information). The slightly different a and b values indicate that the layers of CuDHHBTN may adopt a slipped parallel packing mode, similar to those found in the hexahydroxybenzene(HHB) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene(HHTP)-basedCucontaining 2D conjugated MOFs (Cu-HHB and Cu-HHTP, respectively) $.^{[17]}$\n2\nIn the attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectra of Co-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN, the -OH stretching vibrations around 3310 cm-1 show partial reduction compared to the corresponding ligands (Figure S14), indicating the progression of the coordination reaction. The -OH stretching vibrations are still observable, which may be attributed to the presence of water molecules in the structure coordinating with the metal ions. Conversely, in Cu-DHHBTN, a significant reduction in the-OH stretching vibration and an almost disappearance of C-OH bending vibration at $\\sim 665 \\space cm^{-1}$ were observed compared to DHHBTN. These observations suggest the complete coordination of catechol units with $Cu^{2+}$ ions. The contents of metal, C, and H in DHHBTN-MOFs were quantified by elemental analysis (Table S1). There exists a certain degree of disparity between the experimental and the theoretical values computed from the molecular formula based on anhydrous models. This variation may arise from the prevalent existence of axial coordination water molecules, interlaminar accumulation of discrete complexes, or crystal defects.[18]\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the three DHHBTN-MOFs revealed the presence of rod-shaped crystallites with lengths ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers and widths expanding up to hundreds of nanometers(Figures 3a-c, Figure S9). Energy dispersive X-ray mapping of three nanorod crystals shows a uniform distribution of carbon, oxygen, and metal elements throughout the samples (Figures S10-S12). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy(HRTEM) imaging offers compelling evidence of the long-range order in DHHBTN-MOFs (Figure S13). Both the crystals of CoDHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN showed perfect periodicity along the c-axis with fringe distances of 2.44 and 2.46 nm for the (100) plane (Figure 3d and Figrue S13a-b), respectively. The orthogonality observed in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) indicates that the 2D layers stack in an eclipsed configuration in\n3\nCo-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN as illustrated in the right of Figure 3d. In contrast to Co- and Ni-DHHBTN, HRTEM imaging perpendicular to the c-axis of Cu-DHHBTN revealed an oscillating pattern of pores (Figure 3e, left). The angular direction of the bright fringes indicated that the orientation of the two-dimensional layer was not exactly perpendicular to the pore axis, as also evident by the lines instead of spots shown in their corresponding FFTs (Figure S13c). These observations, again, suggested slipped parallel packing mode in Cu-DHHBTN (Figure 3e, right). consistent with its PXRD analysis (Figure S7c). A similar phenomenon has also been observed in Cu-HHTP, which can be interpreted as stacking faults. $^{[17c]}$ Additionally, as depicted in these HRTEM images obtained along the c direction (Figure 3f, Figures S13d-f), distinct reticular structures with approximately hexagonal pores are observable. The FFT analysis (Figure 3f, inset) further corroborated that the DHHBTN-MOF crystals exhibited a predicted long-range ordered backbone structure.\nThermogravimetric analysis of Co-DHHBTN and NiDHHBTN demonstrated weight losses of about 20.6$\\%$ and 18.2$\\%$at 473 K, respectively, while Cu-DHHBTN showed a weight loss of approximately 13.7$\\%$ at 393 K (Figure S18). The higher weight loss observed in Co-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN could be attributed to the presence of water or guest molecules in the materials. The permanent porosity of M-DHHBTN MOFs was evaluated through $N_{2}$ sorption experiments at a low temperature of 77 K (Figure S32). The N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of M-DHHBTN MOFs are $136.1 \\space m^{2}g^{-1}, \\space 72.4 \\space m^{2}\\space g^{-1},$ and $229.5 \\space m^{2}$ g-1 for Co-DHHBTN, Ni-DHHBTN, and Cu-DHHBTN, respectively The pore size distribution indicates that M-DHHBTN MOFs have microporous structures with pore distribution at 1.0-1.2 nm(Figure S33), which is in excellent agreement with theoretical outcomes. Combined with the aforementioned PXRD analysis, it is evident that a heterogeneous double-pore structure with a ringin-ring motif is formed in M-DHHBTN MOFs.\nAnalysis of the electronic structure\nTo probe the valency state and atomic neighboring chemical structure of the Co, Ni, and Cu transition metal centers, X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) spectra were collected at their respective K edges (Figures S29a-S31a). The extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) oscillation, specifically the k3weighted x(k) spectra of DHHBTN-MOFs, exhibits remarkable similarity (Figures S29b-S31b), implying that the coordination environments of metal atoms in M-DHHBTN are essentially identical. The Fourier transform (FT) spectra of the EXAFS oscillation, which is $k^{3}-$ weighted x(k), at the K-edge of DHHBTNMOFs reveal information about the nearby atoms, such as oxygen and carbon atoms, that are in close proximity to the metal atoms(Figures 4a-c, Figures S29c-S31c). According to the structural model of M-DHHBTN MOFs, the Co-O, Ni-O, and Cu-O scattering paths in R-space are identified to be approximately 1.6 A, 1.6 A. and 1.4 A, respectively. These values closely mirror the distances observed in metal oxides of CoO, NiO, and CuO, confirming the MO4-type linkage in M-DHHBTN.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the surface elemental composition of M-DHHBTN. The survey spectra of M-DHHBTN clearly show distinct resonance signals corresponding to C, O, and the corresponding metal, consistent with the desired composition of the materials (Figure S15-S17). In the Co 2p region at Co-DHHBTN, the main peaks observed at binding energies of 781.6 and 797.4 eV with the presence of satellite peaks can be assigned to Co(II) $2p_{3/2}$ and Co(II) $2p_{1/2}$ ,respectively (Figure 4d and Figure S15d). Additionally, the high-resolution scan of the Ni 2p region exhibited a typical spectrum of $Ni^{2+}$ (Figure 4e and Figure S16d). Cu $2p_{3/2}$ spectrum of Cu-DHHBTN revealed a major peak at 935.0 eV and a minor\n4\npeak at 932.6 eV, corresponding to $Cu^{2+}$ and $Cu^{+}.$ The deconvolution of Cu 2p indicates a prevalent distribution of $Cu^{2+}$ over $Cu^{+}$ in a $Cu^{2+}/Cu^{+}$ ratio of 4:1 (Figure 4f). In the XPS spectrum of O 1s (Figure S17c), two distinct peaks assigned to C-O and C=O functionalities, respectively, can be observed. C 1s region of M-DHHBTN can be also deconvoluted to multiple peaks ascribed to C-C, C-O, and C=O bonds, respectively (Figure S17b). The presence of two different types of bonds between carbon and oxygen suggests the existence of mixed valency state of DHHBTN ligand, possibly as catechol, semiquinone, and quinone, in the DHHBTN MOFs. $^{[17a]}$ The occurrence of mixed valence states of the ligand in M-DHHBTN and Cu in CuDHHBTN could be attributed to the redox process between the organic ligand and the metal ions during the synthesis, which can create conductive pathways to facilitate charge transfer between different valence states, thereby enhancing the overall conductivity of the MOFs material.[19]\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of CoDHHBTN and Cu-DHHBTN exhibited strong and wide EPR signals at g values of 2.09 and 2.12, which are characteristic of the $Co^{2+}-$ and Cu2+-centered radicals (Figures 4g, i and Figures S28b, d). Besides, a minor and narrow signal with a g-factor of 1.99 can also be observed in Co-DHHBTN, indicating the coexistence of a radical signal from the core of the organic ligand(Figures S28a-b). In contrast, Ni-DHHBTN only displayed a weak signal at g=1.99 from ligand-centered radical, consistent with the diamagnetic $Ni^{2+}$ in this material (Figure 4h and Figure S28c).\nElectronic Properties\nSolid-state ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectra were conducted to investigate the absorption bands and optical band gaps of DHHBTN-MOFs (Figures 5a-c). All three MDHHBTN MOFs exhibited significant absorption peaks near 336 nm in the near ultraviolet region (Figure S26), corresponding to the electron transition of the DHHBTN ligand in the material. Interestingly, in Cu-DHHBTN, a notably broad absorption band is evident near 920 nm in the near-infrared region (Figure 5c). This characteristic absorption is likely attributed to the charge migration and coordination field transition of the metal ions within the material. The Tauc equation is employed to evaluate the optical properties of materials, particularly their band gaps. Based on the Tauc plot analysis, the estimated band gaps for CoDHHBTN, Ni-DHHBTN, and Cu-DHHBTN are found to be 1.65, 1.40, and 1.29 eV, respectively (Figure S27).\n5\nThe electrical conductivity of DHHBTN-MOFs was evaluated by employing the four-point probe method on a pressed pellet with a thickness of 0.3 mm. The electrical conductivity values for CoDHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN at room temperature are $2.92 \\times 10^{-8}S$ $cm^{-1}$ and $4.52 \\space \\times \\space 10^{-7}\\space S \\space\\text{cm}^{-1},$ respectively (Figures 5d-e). Remarkably, the bulk conductivity of Cu-DHHBTN reached 0.21 Scm-1 at 298 K, This value ranked in the same order of magnitude as the benchmark MOF Cu-HHTP (0.2 S cm-1) in previous $reports^{[20]}$ and far exceeds that of other Cu-based 2D conjugated MOFs, including Cu-HHB $(1.2 \\times 10^{-6}Scm^{-1})^{[17a,17b]}$ and Cu-HHTN $(9.55 \\space \\times \\space 10^{-10}\\space S \\space\\text{cm}^{-1})$ made from 2,3,8,9,14,15hexahydroxytrinaphthylene(HHTN) $.^{[21]}$ The conductivity of the bulk polycrystalline pellets of M-DHHBTN MOFs demonstrated a nearly exponential increase with the rising of temperature, indicating prominent semiconducting behavior (Figure 5f). This relationship conforms to the Arrhenius equation, allowing the calculation of the activation energy (Ea) associated with charge carrier transport, which is determined to be 0.36, 0.42, and 0.15 eV for Co-DHHBTN, Ni-DHHBTN, and Cu-DHHBTN, respectively(see section 14 in Supporting Information).\nTo investigate the magnetic properties of DHHBTN-MOFs, temperature-variable magnetic susceptibility measurements were conducted over the temperature range of 2-300 K. The fieldcooled (FC) and zero field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization tests show that the magnetization of the three materials increases with decreasing temperature, indicating the typical paramagnetism of the three materials. FC and ZFC curves of both Co-DHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN were nearly identical within the tested temperature range, indicating the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 2 K (Figures 5g-h), consistent with their magnetic hysteresis tests which did not exhibit any hysteretic behavior (Figure S37). However, notable distinctions are observed between the ZFC and FC curves of Cu-DHHBTN (Figure 5i and Figure S35c). Similar deviations have been reported in systems with pronounced $\\pi -d$ interactions, indicating possible local magnetic ordering as opposed to bulk magnetic ordering.[22] These deviations could also result from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, leading to magnetic glassiness. $^{[23]}$ It is plausible that both of these mechanisms may coexist in Cu-DHHBTN, contributing to its unique magnetic properties. The fitting of the paramagnetic susceptibility Xm,p against temperature using CurieWeiss law yielded Curie constant of 4.42,8.04,and 28.21 emu K/mol for Co-DHHBTN, Cu-DHHBTN, and Cu-DHHBTN, respectively (see section 15 in Supporting Information). The increased Curie constant observed in Cu-DHHBTN suggests the potential for robust spin interactions. The departure from the Curie-Weiss law between Ni-DHHBTN and Cu-DHHBTN at lower temperatures (2-200 K) may be ascribed to the existence of local magnetic order, a phenomenon observed in analogous strong $\\pi -$ d conjugated systems.[24]\n6\nDFT calculations provide a deeper understanding of the observed electronic property of M-DHHBTN. The electronic structure of the ligand[25] plays a crucial role in determining the charge transfer characteristics of 2D MOFs. With the expansion of the conjugated system from benzene to triphenylene to HBTN, notable decreases in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) and increases in the highest occupied molecular orbital(HOMO) energy level are observed, which offers HBTN good energy level matches with nodes $MO_{4}(M=$ Co,Ni,and Cu)(Figure 6a, Figure S19 and Table $S2)^{[25-26]}.$ Consequently, the Brillouin zone of the single-layer model of Cu-DHHBTN exhibits dispersed bands crossing the Fermi level in the in-plane directions along the $\\lceil -M$ and $K- \\lceil$ vectors (Figure S23). The density of states (DOS) values near the Fermi level of Cu-DHHBTN, contributed from C, O, and Cu orbitals, are higher than those of Cu-HHB, Cu-HHTP, and Cu-HHTN (Figure S23). This observation highlights the more favored electron delocalization in the heterogeneous double-pore topology of Cu-DHHBTN using DHHBTN ligand with a branched conjugation. $^{[27]}$ Differential charge density calculations offer the direct visualization of increased charge density within the rectangular pore of CuDHHBTN compared to its hexagonal pores, indicating that electron transport pathways along both the rectangular and hexagonal skeletons of Cu-DHHBTN are feasible (Figure S25). Despite that DHHBTN has more expanded $\\pi -$ configuration than HHB, HHTP, and HHTN, its special branched $\\pi -$ conjugation ligand leads to the formation of the ring-in-ring topology of the MOF in which the long-distance electron transport within ligands and metal ions can be circumvented. In fact, Cu ions are arranged more compactly in Cu-DHHBTN than in Cu-HHTP with a smallersized ligand than DHHBTN (Figure S25). In a multi-layer stacking mode, the $\\pi - \\pi$ interaction of the ligand in Cu-DHHBTN results in larger band dispersion of 1.24 eV crossing the Fermi level along out-of-plane directions(「-A,H-K,and M-L)(Figures 6b-c and\nFigure S24), compared to Cu-HHB (0.42 eV), Cu-HHTP (0.99 eV), and Cu-HHTN (1.19 eV).\nThe difference in the band structure and DOS of M-DHHBTN MOFs is mainly reflected in the position of flat metal bands(Figures S20-22), which may be related to the metal-dependent electronic property found in M-DHHBTN. The flat band contributed by the unoccupied $M^{2+}$ orbitals in DHHBTN-MOFs is positioned above the Fermi level, which affects the process of trapping electrons and preventing electron/hole recombination during photophysical $excitation^{[28]}.$ Such difference could originate from the energy level match of frontier orbitals of the HBTN core and $MO_{4}$ nodes shown in Figure 6a, where the best match was found to be between HBTN and CuO4 linkage. [25] The effective carrier masses of holes $(m_{h})$ and electrons $(m_{e}),$ as deduced from the band diagrams of the three DHHBTN-MOFs, are 16.7 and $2.56 \\space m_{0}$ for Co-DHHBTN, 3.59 and $2.76 \\space m_{0}$ for Ni-DHHBTN, and 3.36 and $5.72 \\space m_{0}$ for Cu-DHHBTN (Table S3), respectively, in which $m_{0}$ represents the rest mass of an electron. The similarly smaller electron effective masses of the three M-DHHBTN MOFs may be due to their dispersed conduction band minimum, while the larger hole effective masses in Co-DHHBTN may be ascribed to its relatively flat valence band maximum.\nTHz photoconductivity and fs transient absorption\nmeasurements\nTo explore the charge transport characteristics of the M-DHHBTN we have utilized ultrafast OPTP spectroscopy. $^{[29]}$ The pumpinduced relative change in the transmitted THz electric field. represented as $\\triangle E/E$ (Figure 6d), is linearly proportional to photoconductivity $(\\triangle \\sigma)$ (Figures S39-40). The photoconductivity of Co-DHHBTN, Ni-DHHBTN, and Cu-DHHBTN reached 0.2,0.8, and 1.2 S $cm^{-1},$ respectively. The variance in photoconductivity among DHHBTN-MOFs may be related to the extent of occupation of the flat metal band upon electron excitation (Figures $S20-22).^{[30]}$ Dynamics analysis showed that the weighted average relaxation time of Cu-DHHBTN is 8.13 ps far exceeds that of CoDHHBTN and Ni-DHHBTN, which are 1.65 ps and 1.98 ps, respectively. Since OPTP dynamics contains two relaxation components, a fast trapping and an electron-hole recombination process, the longer weighted average relaxation time in CuDHHBTN (Table S5), indicating an extended carrier lifetime, will contribute to its photoconductivity. $^{[31]}$\nTo gain insights into the charge transport mechanism, we conducted measurements of the complex frequency-resolved photoconductivity $(\\Delta \\sigma(\\omega))$ on the M-DHHBTN films (Figures 6e-g) Our findings indicated that the conduction behavior of photogenerated charge carriers can be effectively characterized by the Drude-Smith model. $^{[32]}$ Based on the best fit of the data, the c approaches -1, indicating that the free motion of carriers is influenced by strong backscattering, likely attributed to grain boundaries or material defects. Subsequently, we deduced the average charge carrier scattering times $(\\tau)$ and estimated the charge carrier mobilities $(\\mu)$ (see section 16-17 in Supporting Information). The r values for Co-DHHBTN, Ni-DHHBTN, and CuDHHBTN are 26, 28, and 48 fs, respectively. Using the effective masses, the room temperature mobility for Co-DHHBTN, NiDHHBTN, and Cu-DHHBTN was calculated to be 1.17, 0.69, and 3.10 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1},$ respectively. These values exceed some classic organic semiconductors such as pentacene and pentathienoacene, and are comparable to some reported 2D conjugated MOFs (Table S6-S7). Based on the Drude-Smith model, the anticipated carrier mobility values for pristine single crystal DHHBTN-MOFs can theoretically fall into the range of 2139 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}(c=0).$\nThe carrier dynamics for M-DHHBTN MOFs and DHHBTN ligand were further investigated using fs-TA measurements. DHHBTN-MOFs showed broad positive signals spanning the entire visible region immediately after photoexcitation, overlapping with dips at 600-650 nm (Figure S44). These positive signals originated from excited-state electron absorption, transitioning from the lower to the higher energy level of the conduction band, while the dips were attributed to exciton bleach resulting from electron $filling^{[30b]}.$ In comparison, the ligand exhibited no exciton bleach signal in the visible region due to the absence of stationary absorption bands (Figure S44a). Excitedstate relaxation dynamics analysis from kinetic traces of MDHHBTN MOFs at 475 nm (Figures S44e-h) gave three time constants (Table S8). The first time constants $t_{1},$ in a time scale of ps, indicated exciton delocalization to ligands or trapping, while $t_{2}$ and $t_{3},$ respectively in the time scale of a few tens of ps and ns, were associated with exciton recombination time constants. $^{[30b,33]}$ We found that $t_{1}$ of Cu-DHHBTN was 2-7 times longer than Coand Ni-DHHBTN, implying the presence of a long lifetime intermediate state. $^{[33b]}$ The weighted average relaxation time of Cu-DHHBTN reached 166.16 ns. Both outcomes agree with the higher photoconductivity in Cu-DHHBTN.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have successfully designed and synthesized three novel 2D conjugated M-DHHBTN MOFs by coordinating transition metals (Co, Ni, and Cu) with an aromatically branched DHHBTN ligand. The utilization of this new ligand with branched conjugation generates two types of pores with different sizes and geometries, resulting in an infinitely extended network with a unique rings-in-ring topology in M-DHHBTN MOF family. The electronic property of three highly crystalline M-DHHBTN MOFs exhibits a strong dependence on the identity of the metal nodes, in which Cu-DHHBTN exhibits a noteworthy room temperature conductivity of 0.21 S cm-1, surpassing other large conjugated systems like coronene and phthalocyanine MOFs. This underscores the superior conductivity of Cu-DHHBTN in the realm of highly conjugated materials. Computational study suggest that a heterogeneous dual pore lattice exhibits a unique band structure compared to a homogeneous pore lattice and provides potential conductive pathways along both its rectangular and hexagonal skeletons. The OPTP spectroscopy unveiled photoconductivity of 0.2 to 1.2 S cm-1 with carrier mobilities ranging from 0.69 to 3.10 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ across the three DHHBTNMOFs. Dynamic analysis by OPTP and fs-TA elucidates that CuDHHBTN exhibits the most favored photoinduced carrier dynamics for achieving high photoconductivity.\nThis study showcases the facile construction of highly conductive and heteroporous 2D framework materials by using\nbranched building blocks with multiple-linking-site, which offers valuable insights for advancing innovative strategies for the integration of high conductivity and hierarchical porosity in 2D MOFs to the next level. The successful acquisition of 2D MOFs with intricate topologies also lays a strong foundation for integrating multiple functions into a single framework. With the continuous advancement of more sophisticated tessellation strategies, we anticipate that the emergence of 2D conductive MOFs with enhanced structural complexity and versatility will advance the development of advanced electronic materials shortly.\nSupporting Information\nThe authors have cited additional references within the Supporting Information. $^{[16,29b,32,33b,34]}$\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22305238), Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2308085MB35), and the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology(2021ZD0303303).

These MOFs feature two distinct types of pores, increasing the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs. The researchers employed powder X-ray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to analyze the tessellation patterns of M-DHHBTN. The carrier mobility of the DHHBTN-based 2D MOFs was measured using optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. The study demonstrates the potential of the branched conjugation of the ligand to introduce heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, suggesting significant implications for future applications of heterogeneous double-pore structures."}

Pabst, Gabriele Hierlmeier,\nPaul O. Peterson, Paul J. Chirik*\nCatalysts that distinguish between electronically distinct carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds without relying on steric effects or directing groups are challenging to design. In this work, cobalt precatalysts supported by N-alkyl-imidazole-substituted pyridine dicarbene (ACNC) pincer ligands are described that enable undirected. remote borylation of fluoroaromatics and expansion of scope to include electron-rich arenes, pyridines, and tri- and difluoromethoxylated arenes, thereby addressing one of the major limitations of first-row transition metal C-H functionalization catalysts. Mechanistic studies established a kinetic preference for C-H bond activation at the meta-position despite cobalt-aryl complexes resulting from ortho C-H activation being thermodynamically preferred. Switchable site selectivity in C-H borylation as a function of the boron reagent was thereby preliminarily demonstrated using a single precatalyst.\nbecause only a subset of electronic defic Check for updates fluorinated arenes provided modest yil. and catalyst deactivation was observed at elevated temperatures (2I). As a result, N-alkylimidazole-substituted pyiidine dicarbene (ACNC)cobalt complexes were pursued because Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are strong electron donors, which offers the possibility of a sterically accessible catalyst that is also thermally robust (24). In this work, we describe the synthesis of sterically attenuated, NHC-based, and pincer-supported cobalt-alkyl and -aryl complexes and their activity for C( $sp^{2})-H$ activation resulting in the borylation of nonfluorinated arenes and heteroarenes and, ultimately, meta-selective C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation of fluoroarenes and tri- and difluoromethoxylated arenes (Fig. 1B). The increased activity enabled switchable site selectivity in catalytic C-H functionalization because cobalt-aryl isomerization was competitive with C-B bond formation.\nSynthesis of well-defined precatalyst\nOur studies commenced with the synthesis of 3,5- $Me_{2}-i^{ipr}$ ACNC)Co(Br $)_{2}(3-Br_{2}).$ Cobalt-alkyl complexes with this class of pincer bearing less sterically encumbering N-alkyl rather than sterically encumbering 2,6-diaryl substituents have been elusive owing to the propensity for competitive formation of bis(chelate) metal complexes (25,26). To circumvent this issue, an optimized procedure was developed whereby 3,5- $Me_{2}-$ (ipr ACNC)(HBr) $_{2}(S1)$ was added to a cold $(-95^{\\circ}C)$ hexanes solution containing excess Co(HMDS $)_{2}($ see supplementary materials for experimental details). This procedure, conducted on a gram scale, furnished a red solid in 93\\% yield identified as 3- $Br_{2}$ that was characterized by x-ray diffraction (Fig. 2A). Addition of 2.1 equivalents of MeLi to a suspension of 3- $Br_{2}$ in diethyl ether followed by filtration and subsequent analysis by proton nuclear magnetic resonance $(^{1}H$ NMR) spectroscopy in benzene $-d_{6}$ established formation of a diamagnetic, $C_{2v}$ symmetriccobalt compound along with $CH_{3}D$ formation. Single crystals obtained from this procedure established the identity of the product as the cobalt-aryl complex $3-C_{6}D_{5}$ arising from C-D activation by a putative cobalt-methyl complex (Fig. 2A). Repeating this procedure in tetrahydrofuran (THF) enabled isolation of 3-Me, and dissolution of the product in benzene $-d_{6}$ rapidly generated the cobalt-phenyl complex, establishing facile C-H activation reactivity. By contrast, the analogous cobalt-methyl complex bearing aryl substituents (4-Me) on the NHCs was unreactive toward activation of benzene $-d_{6}$ even upon heating to $80 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 24 hours. To rationalize the differences in reactivity between 3-Me and 4-Me, the solid-state structures were analyzed and used to generate topographical steric maps using SambVca 2.1 (27)\n-H functionalization has enhanced chemical synthesis by providing a direct method for the activation of otherwise inert bonds, providing a straightforward route U to molecules with applications as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and aromatics relevant to materials science. The development of site-selective reactions remains a grand challenge in metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization(1). A recent analysis of benzenoid-containing small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) approved through 2019 revealed that the most common substitution patterns(1,2-; 1,4-; and 1,2,4-) are accessible by electrophilic aromatic substitution $(S_{E}$ Ar), whereas the least common (1,3-; 1,3,5-; and 1,2,3,5-) are absent because of the lack of methods for their synthesis (2). Thus, remote C-H functionalization methods for the selective formation of one constitutional isomer are transformative. Site-selective C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation represents one of the most impactful C-H functionalization methods in organic synthesis because the C-B bond installed is readily and selectively transformed to a variety of other substituents using robust and well-established chemistry (3-7).\nProgress in C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation has centered on state-of-the-art iridium precatalysts, such as [Ir(COD)OMe $]_{2}$ (where COD is 1,5cyclooctadiene), in combination with bipyridine ligands that operate principally with sterically driven site selectivity (8-11). To overcome the limitations of steric control, developments in regioselective iridium-catalyzed C-H borylation have relied on directing groups and intricate ligand engineering to exploit noncovalent interactions of specific functional groups with a recognition element on the ligand or an additive that orients the distal C-H bonds in proximity to the metal (I2-16) (Fig. 1A). Although advances in ligand design have addressed the inherent sterically driven site selectivity, remote C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation of medicinally relevant molecules, such as fluoroarenes, remains a substantial challenge owing to the weak coordinating ability of fluoro substituents and their similar size to hydrogen (I7). As a result, a general method for remote C-H boryl ation of fluoroarenes has not been reported. Given the prevalence of fluorine in pharmaceuticals and the paucity of methods for nondirected, site-selective remote borylation, methods to synthesize or directly functionalize fluoroarenes are desirable (Fig. 1A). Inspired by accounts of cobalt catalysts supported by electron-rich pincer ligands offering complementary regioselectivity compared with iridium, the development of a cobalt-catalyzed remote C-H borylation was pursued (18-21).\nThe overall performance of first-row transition metal C-H borylation catalysts is limited by low activity, which in turn limits scope and overall synthetic utility (20,2I). To overcome the limitations of previously reported cobalt catalysts, rigid but sterically accessible pincer ligands were targeted that are designed to limit destabilizing steric interactions during C-H activation and are supported by strong $\\sigma$ donors, resulting in a more electronrich metal center (Fig. 1C). For example, computational studies on C-H activation with ortho-to-fluorine selective pyridine-bisphosphine cobalt complex [4-Me-(iPrPNP)Co $(H)_{2}$ BPin] $[1-(H)_{2}$ BPin] established a late transition state for C-H oxidative addition arising from distortion of the flexible pincer and steric interactions between the alkyl substituents on the phosphine(22,23). Although the rigid terpyridine-cobaltalkyl complex 5,5''- $Me_{2}-(^{Ar}$ TpyCo)( $CH_{2}SiMe_{3})$ (2- $CH_{2}SiMe_{3})$ enabled meta-to-fluorine selectivity by rate-and selectivity-determining C-H activation, the electron-deficient nature of the ligand inherently limits its performance\n1 of 6\n(Fig.2B).Comparison of the two plots shows significant shielding above and below the XZ plane defined by the CNC pincer plane by the wingtips of 4--Me. Notably, 4--Me has a significantly higher buried volume compared with 3-Me. These results illustrate that multiple catalyst design principles must be satisfied. For example, despite being supported by strong donors, the steric disposition of the wingtip substituents on 4-Me diminishes reactivity toward C-H activation.\nReaction development\nGiven the rapid activation of benzene, the C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation activity of 3-Me was evaluated (Fig. 3). Standard conditions for catalytic experiments used 1 equivalent of arene and 1 equivalent of $B_{2}Pin_{2}$ with 5 mol \\% of 3-Me at room temperature in THF for 24 hours. A series of 3-substituted (6a to 6e) fluoroarenes was evaluated, and the desired meta-fluoroarylboronates were obtained in high yield (>75\\%) and regioselectivity [>85:15 meta-to-ortho (m:0)]. The substrates evaluated contain directing groups commonly used in metal-catalyzed directed functionalization and led to lower yields when previously reported 2- $CH_{2}SiMe_{3}$ was used (eeg, 6b to 6d)(28). In previous studies, a substratecontrolled selectivity has been observed with fluorinated-aryl boronate esters (29). For example, when 6f and 6g were functionalized with precatalyst $1-(H)_{2}$ BPin, the selecivity was inverted from 94:4 m:o to 20:80, respectively. Although mechanistically informative, changes in selectivity with minor modifications to the substrate limit predictability and ultimately hamper synthetic utility. Improved yields and catalyst-controlled high meta-selectivity were observed with 3-Me, which highlights the superior performance of the NHC-based pincer cobalt precatalyst. A series of 2,6-difluoroaryls containing functional groups-including boronates, ethers, and esters (6h to 6m)-was examined, and in all cases, high yields (>80\\%) and selectivities (>87:13 m:o) were obtained. The parato-boron and meta-tofluorine selectivity was observed independent of the substrate, which highlights the insensitivity of 3-Me to substrate modifications and provides a more general and synthetically useful C-H borylation route to mixed diborylarenes. To probe the borylation selectivity of arenes with sterically accessible ortho-(to fluorine),meta-, and paraC-H bonds, a series of 2-substituted fluoroarenes was examined. The meta-arylboronate esters were the major products for all substrates studied (60 to 6s).\nPyridines are an important class of substrate as the second most encountered heterocycle in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved pharmaceuticals, and they present electronically distinct C-H bonds [e.g., based on bond dissociation free energies (BDFES) and $pK_{a}$ values (where $K_{a}$ is the acid dissociation constant)](30). Borylation of 6-fluoro2-picoline (6t) with 3-Me furnished the(hetero)arylboronate product in 91\\% yield with 99:1 regioselectivity favoring the 4-position. The previously reported cobalt precatalyst 2- $CH_{2}SiMe_{3}$ suffered from low yields, whereas iridium/bipyridine catalysts provided poor selectivity (31-33). Borylation of a series of substituted pyridines (6u to 6aa) with 3-Me furnished the desired 4-functionalized products in good yields and selectivities greater than 87:13. The borylation of pyridines typically requires a directing group or the inclusion of sterically demanding aluminum-based Lewis acids to achieve synthetically useful selectivities (34).\nNext, the overall performance of the designed pyridine dicarbene cobalt precatalyst was evaluated and compared with previously reported precatalysts. Standard conditions for catalytic experiments used 1 equivalent of both arene and $B_{2}Pin_{2}$ in the presence of 5 mol \\% of cobalt precatalyst in THF at ambient or elevated temperatures. Among the precatalysts evaluated, 3-Me was the only one effective for the catalytic borylation of 1,3-dimethoxybenzene(6ab), reaching 50\\% conversion at $80^{\\circ}C.$ With relatively electron-rich substrates (6ab to 6ae), solvent or excess quantities are often required for borylation activity with prior cobalt catalysts. Trifluoromethoxybenzene (6af) and a related derivative (6ag) were borylated at $23 ^\\circ\\text{C}$\n2 of 6\nusing 3-Me to afford the meta-functionalized product with regioselectivity ratios of 91:9 and 99:1 m:o, respectively. Both $1-(H)_{2}$ Bpin and 2- $CH_{2}SiMe_{3}$ failed to catalyze any detectable formation of the desired products even upon extended heating at $80 ^\\circ\\text{C} .$ High meta-selectivity(84:16) was also observed with difluoromethoxy groups (6ah). Trifluoromethoxy ( $OCF_{3})$ and difluoromethoxy ( $OCF_{2}H),$ typically introduced by radical addition, are highly desirable structural motifs in drug development processes because of their ability to fine-tune the physicochemical properties of drug candidates (35). These results highlight the importance of developing more active first-row metal catalysts because electronically controlled selectivity can be compatible with funciional groups not amenable to directing group strategies.\nThe cobalt precatalyst with a phosphine-based pincer, $1-(H)_{2}$ Bpin, promotes para-to-boronate ester selectivity; however, the scope is limited to electron-deficient fluorinated arylboronate esters (29). To generalize the electronically controlled selectivity, phenylboronic acid pinacol ester(6ai) and phenylboronic acid neopentylglycol ester (6aj) were examined and failed to give any of the desired product with any previously reported catalyst. Borylation with 3-Me provided the desired products in 58\\% and 56\\%yields with 77:23 and 82:18 respective regioselectivity favoring funciionalization at the para-toboronate site. Among the precatalysts evaluated, 3-Me was the only one effective for the cat alytic borylation of methyl benzoate (6ak), providing the desired product in 64\\% yield with a regioselectivity of 77:23 favoring functionalization at the para-to-ester site. To evaluate the electronic influence of multiple substituents on an arene, substrates 6al, 6am, and 6an were evaluated. One regioisomer was obtained when 6al was evaluated, which highlights the reinforced para-to-ester and meta-to-fluorine selectivity. Borylation of 6am led to one regioisomer, whereas 6an led to preferential functionalization at the para-to-boronate site, overriding the meta-to-fluorine selectivity. 1,4 disubstituted fluoroarenes were also viable substrates. For example, borylation of 4fluorotoluene and 4-fluorobenzotrifluoride led to preferential functionalization ortho-tofluorine over sterically inaccessible C2 functionalization(figs. S133 and S134). The presence of $Csp^{2}-X$ bonds in aromatics presents a chemoselectivity challenge because previously reported cobaltcatalyzed $Csp^{2}-H$ borylation methods are incompatible with aryl halide substituents. For example, chlorobenzene (6ao) was an incompatible substrate with previously reported cobalt catalyst $1-(H)_{2}$ Bpin and 2- $CH_{2}$ SiMe but was borylated in 61\\% yield and 86:14 regioselectivity favoring meta-to-chlorine product with 3-Me, which highlights the specific kinetic preference for C-H over C-Cl borylation. To demonstrate the utility of the\ncobalt-catalyzed method for gram-scale synthesis, etoxazole (5ap), a chitin synthesis inhibitor, underwent borylation in 97\\% yield to afford 6ap. In situ activation of 3- $Br_{2}$ with $KBHEt_{3}$ using standard Schleck technique could also be applied, resulting in the borylation of etoxazole(5ap) in 52\\% yield (fig. S9). Recent advancements in cross-coupling with Earth-abundant metals have been developed between alkyl and aryl halides with neopentylglycol(hetero)aryl boronic esters (36). To benefit from the distinctive site selectivity, a method was developed to synthesize neopentylglycolaryl boronic esters with 3-Me and applied to the derivatization of etoxazole. Under the optimized conditions using bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron, the desired product 7 was obtained in 91\\% isolated yield and characterized by x-ray diffraction. Performing the reaction with 2- $CH_{2}$ SiMe did not lead to the desired product, which highlights the limitations of previously reported cobalt catalysts for remote C-H borylation.\nMechanistic studies\nTo gain insight into the origin of selectivity for C-H borylation, the synthesis of cobalt(I)fluoroaryl complexes relevant to catalysis were pursued. Treatment of a benzene $-d_{6}$ solution of 3-Me with excess fluoroarene (8) at room temperature resulted in the formation of the corresponding cobalt(I)-aryl complex 3- $Ar^{F}$ arising from C-H activation at the ortho-tofluorine site (Fig. 4A). No other signals corresponding to isomers of 3- $Ar^{F}$ were detected by $^{19}F$ NMR spectroscopy. Notably, the preferred C-H bond activated during catalysis is the meta-to-fluorine site leading to the meta-tofluoroarylboronate product. To probe for intramolecular or pinacolborane (HBPin)-induced isomerization after the generation of the cobaltaryl complex, the reaction of 3- $Ar^{F}$ with HBPin was examined. Treatment of 3- $Ar^{F}$ with excess HBPin resulted in the exclusive formation of the ortho-to-fluorine borylated product (Fig.4A): No other isomers of the arylboronate were detected by $^{19}F$ NMR spectroscopy, which rules out isomerization before C-B bond formation. To rationalize the discrepancy between the stoichiometric experiments leading to the ortho-Co(I)aryl complex and the major product observed in catalysis arising from C-B bond formation at the meta-site, the stoichiometric reaction of 3-Me with a series of fluoroarenes was monitored by NMR spectroscopy. Treatment of 3 of 6\n4 of 6\n3-Me with excess 1,3-difluorobenzene at room temperature furnished $3-(3,5-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ (wherein the fluorine substituents are both meta to the cobalt-aryl bond) as the major product after 30 min. After 24 hours, $3-(3,5-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ was converted to $3-(2,6-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2}),$ wherein both fluorine substituents occupy ortho-positions. With fluorobenzene, similarly distinct kinetic and thermodynamic preferences were observed as the meta-aryl isomer formed at early reaction times, then underwent isomerization to the ortho-variant as the reaction progressed (fig.S6) No detectable quantities of the para-isomer were observed $by^{19}F$ NMR spectroscopy throughout the course of the experiment (Fig. 4B). To probe the mechanism of cobalt-aryl isomerization, a kinetic ratio of $3-(3,5-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ and $3-(2,6-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ in 0.4 ml of THF $-d_{8}$ was transferred to a J-Young NMR tube, and the mixture was directly analyzed $by^{19}F$ NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 4C). After 24 hours, the ratio of $3-(3,5-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ to $3-(2,6-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ did not change. However, upon addition of excess 1,3 difluorobenzene, complete conversion to $3-(2,6-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ was observed. These results demonstrate that excess fluoroarene is required for cobalt-aryl isomerization to occur. These observations support kinetically preferred C-H activation at the position meta-to-fluorine and thermodynamically favored formation of the ortho-isomer (37,38). The free energies of the fluoroaryl isomers were calculated with density functional theory (DFT) using the $\\omega B97$ XD functional and the def2-TZVP basis set and corroborate the experimental observations that $3-(2,6-C_{6}H_{3}F_{2})$ is lowest in energy as a result of a thermodynamic orthoto-fluorine effect (Fig. 4B). Experimental support for these trends with first-row metals has not previously been reported owing to the lack of reactivity of the metal-aryl complexes, which are typically synthesized by the addition\n5 of 6\nof an organometallic reagent to the metal halide precursors.\nThe observed aryl isomerization suggested that switchable site selectivity in catalytic C-H borylation should be possible. We postulated that if cobalt-aryl isomerization were faster than C-B bond formation, the selectivity would be inverted to favor the ortho-fluoroarylboronate product (Fig. 4C). Stirring a THF solution of 8 with HBPin with 5 mol \\% of 3-Me at $50 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ produced boronate ester 9a in 94\\% yield and a 24:76 ratio favoring the ortho-isomer (ortho-8a). The switch in selectivity is attributed to a slower rate of C-B bond formation when using HBPin.\nTo assess the rate of C-B bond formation as a function of boron reagent, the catalytic borylation of 5a with $B_{2}Pin_{2}$ and HBPin was monitored $by^{19}F$ NMR spectroscopy as a function of time (figs. S24 and S25). With HBPin, 19\\%conversion was observed after 19 hours. By contrast, with $B_{2}Pin_{2},80 \\%$ conversion was observed in 10 min. These results support a faster rate of C-B bond formation with $B_{2}Pin_{2}.$ Repeating the experiment with DBPin resulted in no signifcant deuterium incorporation in 9a (fig.S27). If DBPin were responsible for cobalt-aryl isomerization, hydrogen isotope exchange of the free arene should be observed, and the orthofunctionalized aryl boronate would contain significant deuterium incorporation at the metato-fluorine site. An inverse relationship was also observed between the selectivity for the orthofluoroaryl boronate ester and the equivalents of HBPin, which does not support an HBPininduced cobalt-aryl isomerization mechanism(table S3). A series of additional mechanistic experiments (fig. S26) suggest that the isomerization to thermodynamically preferred cobalt-aryl takes place by intermolecular C-H activation of a second arene by meta-to-fluoroaryl cobalt intermediate. The preferred site of boryl ation was also switched when 5a and 5c were used as substrate (Fig. 4D). The different selectivities were obtained from a single catalyst by simply changing between two commercially available boron reagents. These observations contrast traditional approaches to switchable selectivity, where different ligands or transition metal complexes are required (39). Switchable C-H borylation was specific to 3-Me because the selectivity did not alter significantly when $1-(H)_{2}$ Bpin and 2- $CH_{2}SiMe_{3}$ were used as precatalyst (fig. S23). On the basis of insights from the stoichiometric experiments, the selectivity to favor formation of the meta-fluoroarylboronate was improved by increasing the equivalents of $B_{2}Pin_{2}.$ For example, stirring a THF solution of 8 and 5e with 2 equivalents of $B_{2}Pin_{2}$ with 5 mol \\% of 3-Me for 24 hours improved the regioselectivity from 3:1 to 4.5:1 and from 3:1 to 5.6:1 in favor of meta-9a and meta-6c, respectively. Further studies are ongoing to expand the switchable C-H borylation scope and lower the equivalents of arene when using HBPin as the boron reagent (fig. S22).\nIntroduction of a sterically attenuated, electron-donating pincer has enabled the development of a cobalt precatalyst that exhibits high activity for C-H activation and C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation. A combination of stoichiometric experiments and site selectivity from catalytic examples demonstrates a kinetic preference for functionalization of sites meta to fluorine that, in the presence of arene substrate, isomerize over time through C-H activation to ortho-aryl complexes. This feature enables switchable selectivity in catalytic C( $sp^{2})-H$ borylation, where tuning the relative rates of C-H activation and C-B bond formation modulates the preference for orthoversus meta-functionalized products. These findings provide key catalyst design principles for site-selective C-H functionalization, exploiting kinetic and thermodynamic preferences of M-C versus C-H bond formation.\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n1.L.Zhang,T.Ritter,J.Am.Chem.Soc.144,2399-2414(2022)\n2.A.Nilova,L.C.Campeau,E.C.Sherer,D.R.Stuart,J.Med.

Here, a carboxyl-functionalized and acryloylterminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized and used as a macro-cross-linker to fabricate a super strong and ultra-tough ionic hydrogel. The terminal acryloyl groups of hyperbranched PCL are chemically incorporated into the network to form covalent cross-links, which contribute to robust networks. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic domains formed by the spontaneous aggregation of PCL chains and coordination bonds between $Fe^{3+}$ and $COO^{-}$ groups serve as dynamic non-covalent cross-links, which enhance the energy dissipation ability. Especially, the influence of the hyperbranched topological structure of PCL on hydrogel properties has been well investigated, exhibiting superior strengthening and toughening effects compared to the linear one. Moreover, the hyperbranched PCL cross-linker also endowed the ionic hydrogel with higher sensitivity than the linear one when used as a strain sensor. As a result, this well-designed ionic hydrogel possesses high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and well ionic conductivity, exhibiting potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.\nIntroduction\nHydrogels have recently attracted increasing attention for a wide range of promising applications due to their soft and fluid nature. $^{[1]}$ However, the application of hydrogels often suffers from their inherent limitations of mechanical properties like low strength and poor toughness. $^{[2]}$ Recently, various strategies have been applied to improve hydrogel's mechanical performances by designing novel network architectures, including constructing multiple networks(double-network and an interpenetrating polymer network) $,^{[3]}$ introducing dynamic interactions (ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, coordination bonds) $,^{[4]}$ developing novel cross-linkers (chemical and physical) $,^{[5]}$ and others. $^{[6]}$ Among them, multiple network hydrogel always involves complicated and multi-step synthesis routes. Compared to multiple network hydrogels, the introduction of dynamic interactions or novel cross-linkers into hydrogels is a simpler and more efficient method to improve their mechanical performance. In particular, macromolecule cross-linkers have recently been reported, which can introduce more free mobile chain segments into the networks to enhance the stretchability compared to small molecule cross-linkers. $^{-77}$ However, overcoming the compromise between the strength and stretchability using these methods remains a challenge, as high stretchability always requires dynamic interactions and flexible chain segmental motion, while high strength is usually obtained by the abundant cross-linking sites and the rigid polymer chain segments. $^{[8]}$\nHyperbranched polymer (HBP), which has a threedimensional spatial molecular configuration, highly branched backbone, and abundant end groups is devoted to improving the mechanical properties of polymer materials. $^{[9]}$ The nonentangled geometry of hyperbranched topology enhances the segmental motion of the flexible polymer chains. Meanwhile, the abundant end groups of HBP could work efficiently to provide sufficient cross-linking sites. Thus, the HBP structure offers an opportunity to overcome the compromise between the strength and the stretchability when used as a macro-cross-linker in networks. However, the use of HBP as a macro-cross-linker of hydrogel has rarely been reported. $^{[7c,10]}$ Also, to the best of our knowledge, the influence of the topological structure of macrocross-linker on the mechanical properties of hydrogel has been ignored. Inspired by the unique properties of HBP, we wonder whether hyperbranched macro-cross-linker and dynamic interactions are simultaneously introduced into the hydrogel networks to yield a dual-cross-linked hydrogel with both chemical and physical cross-linkages. Thus, the covalent/non-covalent cross-linking balance in the networks could be in effect controlled by the hyperbranched structure, aiming to impart high strength, extra stretchability, and high toughness to hydrogels.\nTo verify our hypothesis, a carboxyl-functionalized and acryloyl-terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone $(A_{x}PCL_{y})$ was used as a macro-cross-linker and introduced into the P(AAm-co-AAc) (namely, poly(acrylamide-coacrylic acid)) hydrogel to construct an ionic hydrogel $(A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{z}).$ As shown in Scheme 1, the $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ was copolymerized with the acrylamide and acrylic acid in DMSO to form an organogel, followed by immersing into a $FeCl_{3}$ solution to perform the solvent exchange process to fabricate the dual-cross-linked hydrogel. On the one hand, the acryloyl terminal groups were incorporated into the network chains through polymerization, contributing to robust networks. On the other hand, non-covalent crosslinks were introduced during the solvent exchange to enhance the energy dissipation ability, including the hydrophobic aggregation of PCL chains and the formation of $Fe^{3+}$ -COO- coordination bonds. Meanwhile, the containing of metal ions in hydrogel also endows it with good conductivity. The optimal balance of covalent/non-covalent crosslinking could be achieved by tuning the hyperbranched structure of $A_{x}PCL_{y},$ to result in the ionic hydrogel possessing high strength, outstanding stretchability, superior toughness, and good conductivity.\nNotably, to the best of our knowledge, the superiority of the hyperbranched topological structure of macro-crosslinker compared to the linear one was investigated for the first time. Taking a carboxyl-functionalized and acryloylterminated linear polycaprolactone $(L_{x}$ PCL) cross-linker as a reference, it was found that the $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ cross-linked ionic hydrogel exhibited significant mechanical properties than the $L_{x}$ PCL cross-linked one. Most importantly, the $A_{x}PCL_{v}$ cross-linked ionic hydrogel exhibited higher sensitivity than $L_{x}PCL_{y}$ cross-linked ionic hydrogel when used as strain sensors. Microstructural characterization indicated that $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ cross-linked ionic hydrogel possessed a more uniform microphase separation morphology, which should be responsible for the excellent performance. These findings show the advantage of HBP macro-cross-linkers in fabricating super strong/ultra-tough hydrogels and thus expand their potential application to flexible ionic conductors.\nResults and Discussion\nDesign, Fabrication, and Characterization of PCL-Based lonic Hydrogels\nThe carboxyl-functionalized and acryloyl-terminated hyperbranched PCL $(A_{x}PCL_{y})$ was synthesized via three steps. As shown in Figure S1, first, t-butyloxycarbonyl-substituted caprolactone and glycidol were copolymerized via a one-pot ring-opening polymerization to synthesize OH-terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone $BPCL_{y}$ using 1,4-benzenedimethanol (BDM) as initiator and diphenyl phosphate(DPP) as a catalyst. $^{[11]}\\space A_{x}PCL_{y}$ was then obtained by reacting the -OH group with acryloyl chloride and deprotecting the t-butyl group with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Here, x represents the degree of substitution (DS) of the acryloyl end groups, and y represents the average degree of polymerization between the adjacent branched sites. To systematically study the influence of hyperbranched structure on the hydrogel properties, a series of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ with different degrees of branching and numbers of end groups were synthesized. Different y values were achieved by using various ratios of t-butyloxycarbonyl-substituted caprolactone to glycidol in the ring-opening polymerization. x value was\ncontrolled by changing the proportion of acryloyl chloride to-OH end groups. Three different ratios of t-butyloxycarbonyl-substituted caprolactone to glycidol, 30:1, 15:1, and 6:1. were used in the ring-opening polymerization, and the y values were 15, 10, and 5, respectively. At a fixed y value, the DS (x) value ranges from 0 to 1. Moreover, to investigate the effect of PCL cross-linker topology structure on the hydrogels, a linear PCL named $L_{x}$ PCL was also synthesized as a reference that possesses a similar molecular weight to $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Their structures were characterized $by^{1}H$ NMR (Figures S3-7, Supporting Information), FT-IR (Figure S8a, Supporting Information), size exclusion chromatography (SEC)(Figure S9, Supporting Information; Table S1-2), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S10, Supporting Information).\nAs shown in Scheme 1, the PCL-based ionic hydrogel was then prepared using $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ as a macro-cross-linker during the copolymerization of acrylamide (AAm) and acrylic acid (AAc) in DMSO to afford organogel $A_{x}PCL_{y}-D.$ The acrylic terminal groups of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ were chemically incorporated into the network chains through polymerization, contributing to covalent cross-linking. $A_{x}PCL_{y}-D$ was then immersed in a $FeCl_{3}$ solution to give hydrogel by solvent exchange. Considering the hydrophobic feature of the PCL chains and the coordination affinity between $Fe^{3+}$ and COO-, the non-covalent cross-links, including hydrophobic domains and the metal coordination bonds were introduced during the solvent exchange. The resulting hydrogel was then immersed in pure water to remove excess $Fe^{3+},$ forming more tridentate coordination complexes completed by reorganizing the coordinates. $^{[12]}$ The resulting hydrogels were denoted as $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{z},$ where z represents the concentration of the $FeCl_{3}$ solution. Here, the concentrations of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ and $FeCl_{3}$ solutions were chosen as 1mol ‰ and 0.1 M, respectively. The characteristic peaks for DMSO (1022 $cm^{-1}$ and 956 $cm^{-1})$ completely disappear in the FT-IR spectrum of the equilibrated hydrogel, indicating that the DMSO is fully removed (Figure S8b, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the peak at 1630 $cm^{-1}$ in the spectrum of as-prepared organogel ascribed to C=O stretching vibration shifted to 1650 $cm^{-1}$ in the equilibrated hydrogel, confirming the formation of metal $Fe^{3+}-$ COO- coordination bonds. Similarly, $L_{x}$ PCL was used as a macro-crosslinker to fabricate $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{z}$ hydrogels as a reference by the same procedure.\nMechanical and Anti-swelling Properties of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{z}$ Hydrogels The original $A_{x}PCL_{y}-D$ organogel is soft and weak (Figure 1a), while the $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{z}$ hydrogels become robust and flexible after solvent exchange, which can sustain various kinds of deformations (Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 1c, $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ does not get punctured in the penetration test and showed excellent recovery, indicating puncture resistance and good recovery properties. Moreover, only $0.05g \\space A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ can lift a 2.5kg weight without rupture, demonstrating ultra-mechanical strength (Figure 1d).\nThe mechanical properties of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{z}$ were then accurately characterized by tensile tests. Figures 2a-b show the effect of acrylate DS on the mechanical properties of the $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}.$ The tensile stress and breaking strain of hydrogels both exhibited a remarkable increase as the acrylate DS increased from 0 to 0.67. As the acrylate DS further increased from 0.67 to 1, the mechanical properties became worse, especially for the breaking strain. As a result, the toughness of the hydrogels increased first and then decreased, reaching its highest value of 44.1 MJ $/m^{3}$ at a DS of 0.67. For the other two $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ cross-linkers (y=5 and 15), similar results were observed (Figure S11a-d, Support-\ning Information). Taking all these above, the optimal mechanic performance was obtained at the moderate DS values, x=0.33, 0.67, and 0.50 for y=5, 10, and 15, respectively. In addition, the average degree of polymerization between the adjacent branched sites of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ also affects the hydrogel mechanics. Compared with $A_{0.50}PCL_{15}-$ $G_{0.1}$ and $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}, \\space A_{0.33}$ exhibited the highest toughness, which has the highest average degree of polymerization between the adjacent branched sites. These results indicate that the structure of the hyperbranched cross-linker plays a key role in the mechanics of hydrogels. Based on this rational design of the hyperbranched topology of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ , the $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels show excellent mechanical performance with a wide range of stretchability (300-1100 $\\%$) and toughness (14.1-44.1 MJ $/m^{3})\\space($ Figure S11, Supporting Information).To further confirm the importance of PCL hyperbranching on the mechanical properties, the properties of $L_{x}$ PCL- $G_{0.1}$ hydrogels were also investigated. For comparison, the number of acrylic end groups of PCL cross-linker was kept the same, since it is an important parameter affecting the covalent cross-linking density and mechanical properties. Figure 2c shows the stress-strain curves of $A_{0}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ and $L_{0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels, for which the number of acryloyl end group are zero and there is no chemical cross-linkage. It can be observed that the $A_{0}PCL_{y}-G_{0,1}$ with hyperbranched crosslinker exhibits similar strength but extra stretchability and high toughness compared to the linear one. Subsequently, the number of terminal acrylic groups was increased to 2 for all the hydrogels (the DS values were not the same), and similar results were observed as shown in Figure 2d. The $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ exhibit similar strength, extra stretchability, and high toughness compared to $L_{1.0}$ PCL $-G_{0,1}.$ These results support that the hyperbranched structure of the cross-linker plays a key role in strengthening and toughening hydrogels. Notably, when the number of terminal acrylic groups increases from 0 to 2, the strength increases (4.2 to 5.1 MPa) and breaking strain decreases (306 to 106 $\\%$) for $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}.$ This should be understood and corresponds to the increase of chemical cross-linking density and decrease of chain mobility, which is normal for the divinyl cross-linking system as shown in previous reports. $^{[13]}$ However, the strength and breaking strain of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ increase simultaneously (e.g. 4.2 to 5.2 MPa and 540 to 666 $\\%$ for $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}),$ which indicates the mechanical properties of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels are not simply determined by the chemical crosslinking density but by the hyperbranched topological structure too.\nEffective control of the water content is also critically important for soft hydrogel materials since high water content usually leads to a significant decline in their mechanical properties. The water content of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels with different compositions was then investigated. As shown in Figure S13a-c (Supporting Information), all the hydrogels exhibited ideal water content $(\\approx 60 $\\%$),$ which might be attributed to the strong binding strength between carboxylic acid and $Fe^{3+}$ leading to a dense network structure. As a comparison, the as-prepared $A_{x}PCL_{10}$ organogels were directly immersed in pure water to give $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ hydrogel, which exhibited a high water content of 96.6$\\%$ for $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ (Figure S14a, Supporting Information). Correspondingly, the mechanical property of $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ is weaker than $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1},$ which will be\ndiscussed later. It is worth noting that the water content of $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels exhibits similar values $(\\approx 60 \\space $\\%$)$ with $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ (Figure S13d, Supporting Information), indicating that the superior mechanical properties of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ compared to $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ is not achieved with the sacrifice of water content. Moreover, the ionic hydrogel can maintain good swelling resistance in water for a long time (more than 6 months, Figure S14b, Supporting Information), endowing it with great application potential in underwater motion detection.\nMicrostructural Analysis and Influence of Hyperbranched\nTopological Structure on Mechanical Properties\n$A_{x}PCL_{y}$ or $L_{x}$ PCL, as a macromolecular cross-linker, not only homogeneously connected hydrophilic P(AAm-coAAc) chains but also formed dynamic cross-linking nodes due to hydrophobic interaction of PCL chains and metal coordination bonds between $Fe^{3+}$ and COO-. As shown in Figure 3a, all the prepared organogels were transparent. while the corresponding hydrogels became opaque due to the formation of hydrophobic PCL domains after solvent exchange. Specifically, the transparency of hydrogels increased with DS value, with an increase of transmission at 700 nm (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The high DS value should result in a high chemical cross-linking density which was further proved by the swelling measurements(Figure S12), restricting the aggregation of hydrophobic PCL chains and increasing transparency. Notably, the highest transmittance of $\\overset{\\rightarrow}{A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}}$ was observed when $\\overset{\\circ}{DS}=$ 0.67, and it decreased when the DS value was further increased to 1.0. Similar results were also observed for $A_{x}PCL_{5}-G_{0.1}$ (Figure S15a, Supporting Information), this may be due to the increased Fe content in $A_{1.0}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels, which affects the transmittance of the gels. To exclude the influence of the Fe element, the $A_{x}PCL_{10}-D$ organogels were immersed in pure water instead of $FeCl_{3}$ solution to give $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ hydrogels. It was found that $A_{1.0}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ exhibited the highest transmittance among $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0},$ proving the restricted formation of hydrophobic domains at a high DS value (Figure S16, Supporting Information).\nSEM was used to further characterize the microstructure of the $A_{x}PCL_{y}-D_{z}$ hydrogels. To confirm the formation of hydrophobic domains and coordination bonds in the hydrogels, the as-prepared organogel $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-D$ was immersed into three kinds of solutions, $H_{2}O, \\space 0.1 MFeCl_{3}$ aqueous solution ( $FeCl_{3}/H_{2}O),$ and 0.1 M $FeCl_{3}$ in DMSO solution( $FeCl_{3}/$ DMSO) giving gels $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0}, \\space A_{0.67}$ , $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-D_{0.1},$ respectively. Immersion of $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}$ organogel in $FeCl_{3}/H_{2}O$ can cause the formation of hydrophobic domains and coordination bonds simultaneously, while $H_{2}O$ only induces the aggregation of hydrophobic chains and $FeCl_{3}/$ DMSO only results in the coordination interaction. As shown in Figure 3b-d, the cross-section of freeze-dried $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ exhibits a homogeneous porous network structure, however, there is no obvious porous microstructure in $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-D_{0.1}$ and $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ due to the shrinkage of the small pores during freeze-drying, indicating a higher crosslink density by introducing $Fe^{3+}.$ In comparison, $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ has a smoother and homogeneous\nstructure than $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0}$ and $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-D_{0.1}$ and exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, due to the synergistic effect of hydrophobic association and coordination interactions (Figure S17, Supporting Information).\nIn our hydrogels, the PCL hydrophobic domain is a minor phase and its volume fraction is much smaller than the highly swollen P(AAm-co-AAc) phase. Therefore, the hydrophobic PCL chains would segregate as dispersed domains and result in phase separation in hydrogels, which can also be observed in their SEM images. $^{[38]}$ As shown in Figure 3d-g, SEM images of freeze-dried $A_{x}PCL_{10^{-}}G_{0.1}$ show the presence of dispersed domains in the hydrogels. Moreover, the size of the PCL domains significantly decreases as the DS increases, which is consistent with the change in hydrogel transparency. Irregularly shaped domains are observed for $A_{0}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ and $A_{0.33}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1},$ while the domains become smaller and inconspicuous for $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-$ $G_{0,1}$ and $A_{1,0}PCL_{10}-G_{0,1}.$ This also proves that increased chemical cross-linking density restricts the aggregation of PCL chains and decreases the domain size. In particular, the dispersed domains in the cross-section of freeze-dried $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0,1}$ are inhomogeneous, and their sizes are larger than that of $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ (Figure 3h-i). This suggests the formation of hydrophobic clusters in the spatial distribution of hydrophobic domains. Compared to hyperbranched $A_{x}PCL_{y},$ the linear chain of $L_{x}$ PCL is more ordered and tends to form more but smaller domains, which can further aggregate to form large-size hydrophobic clusters. $^{[14]}$ These hydrophobic clusters with strong physical interactions in $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ should be responsible for their higher modulus than $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ as shown in Figure 2. In addition, the size of the hydrophobic clusters also decreased as the DS value for $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}.$\nThe phase-separated structure of hydrogels was then confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. In the AFM images, the dispersed hydrophobic PCL domains are bright, and interconnected PAAm-PAAc domains appear dark (Figure 4 and Figure S18, Supporting Information). The PCL domain's size decreases as the DS value increases, confirming that high covalent cross-linking density limits the aggregation of PCL chains. Especially, the hydrogels $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ and $A_{1.0}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ with high DS values show the typical microphase separation morphology and bright PCL spheres with a size of 62 nm and 58 nm, respectively (Figure 4e-f). In addition, smaller domains were observed for $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ than $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ (Figure 4a-b). Due to the inhomogeneous distribution of these domains, some neighboring PCL domains can form hydrophobic clusters in the hydrogel networks, which is consistent with the SEM results. Among all the AFM images, $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-$ $G_{0.1}$ exhibits the most uniform microphase separation morphology, which must be responsible for its better mechanical properties.\nThe formation of PCL domains in $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ was further analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the scattering peak is associated with the scattering of neighboring PCL domains. The position of the scattering peak is indicative of the average inter-domain distance (d, $d=2 \\pi /q,$ where q is the position of the SAXS scattering peak). Figure 5a shows the SAXS patterns of $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ with different DS values. It is observed that all SAXS curves showed wide scattering peaks, indicating the existence of hydrophobic domains. With the DS value increasing from 0 to 1, the scattering peak position shifted to a lower q value $(q_{0}=0.195, \\space q_{0.33}=0.189, \\space q_{0.67}=0.184, \\space q_{1.0}=0.171)$ and gradually broadened and disappeared, indicating an increased inter-domain distance and decreased domain size. Figure 5b shows the SAXS patterns of $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0,1},$ exhibiting no significant scattering peak. This might be due to the large size and inhomogeneous dispersion of hydrophobic clusters in the hydrogels.\nThe DS of the $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ not only influences the aggregation of PCL chains but also affects the formation of coordination bonds. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS) was employed for the elemental analysis of the hydrogels (Figure S19, Supporting Information). It shows peaks caused by Fe, O, and C elements that can prove the existence of metal coordination interaction. Table S3 shows that the Fe element content in $A_{x}PCL_{10^{-}G_{0.1}}$ significantly increased with DS, indicating that more coordination interactions were introduced in the hydrogels with high DS values. This result is consistent with the previous discussion about the transparency of $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1},$ for which the transmittance of $A_{1.0}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ is lower than $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}.$ A low DS value is helpful for the formation of hydrophobic domains, which can hinder the carboxyl groups of $A_{x}PCL_{1}$ and prevent $Fe^{3+}$ from moving inside the gel simultaneously, resulting in low coordination bond content.\nTaking all these above, the effect of the topology structure of PCL cross-linker on the microstructure and mechanics of hydrogels can be concluded. On the one hand, compared to hyperbranched PCL, the linear PCL chain is more ordered and tends to form more but smaller hydrophobic domains, which can further aggregate to form largesize hydrophobic clusters in the hydrogels (Figure 6). The strong physical interactions in clusters can significantly improve the modulus but impair the stretchability of the hydrogels. On the other hand, the aggregation of the hyperbranched PCL chain is affected by the DS value. Low acrylate DS results in low covalent cross-linking density, but promotes the aggregation of PCL chains and results in larger PCL domains. The size of the PCL domain further influences the formation of coordination interactions. PCL domains with large sizes can hinder the carboxyl groups of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ and prevent $Fe^{3+}$ from moving inside the gel to decrease the coordination bond content. As a result, the covalent and non-covalent cross-linking density of the networks can be simultaneously tuned by regulating the hyperbranched structure of $A_{x}PCL_{v}$ to optimize the mechanical properties of $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{z}$ hydrogels. It was proved that the optimal balance of covalent/non-covalent cross-linking can be achieved with a moderate DS value of $A_{x}PCL_{y}$ to give strong and ultra-tough hydrogels.\nThe Energy Dissipation Mechanism and Self-Recovery\nPerformance\nRheological measurements were carried out for $A_{x}PCL_{10}-$ $G_{0.1}$ and $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ to evaluate the influence of hyperbranched structure on hydrogel mechanics. Figure 7a shows the frequency dependence of rheological behavior for $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ and $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}.$ The storage modulus (G') is higher than the loss modulus (G'') throughout the frequency range, indicating the elastic nature of all hydrogels. $^{[15]}$ $L_{1.0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ exhibits the highest G' value than others, due to the formation of covalent cross-linkage and large hydrophobic clusters. On the contrary, $L_{0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ shows the lowest G' value, due to the lack of covalent cross-linkage and low $Fe^{3+}$ content. For $A_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1},$ the highest G' value was observed for the moderate DS value (x=0.67), which is consistent with the tensile tests. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of complex viscosity (Z*, Pa s) was also plotted in Figure 7b. It is well known that a certain quantitative relationship should exist between log $\\eta ^{*}$ and log w and its line slope should be close to -1 for a perfect covalent crosslinked network. $^{[16]}$ As shown in Figure 7b, the slope values(k) of the lines of $L_{0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ and $A_{0}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}\\space(-0.93$ and-0.88) are the highest, since there are no covalent crosslinkages. Conversely, the slope values of $L_{1.0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ and $A_{1.0}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}\\space(-0.95)$ are closer to -1 due to their high covalent crosslinking density. In particular, $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ showed the lowest slope value (-0.96) which is closer to -1, indicating that the optimal covalent/non-covalent cross-linking balance was achieved to result in the near-perfect elastic network. Figure 7c shows the strain dependence of rheological behavior for $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ and $L_{x}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}.$ The flow point, the strain at which the storage modulus equals loss modulus, shows different positions for all hydrogels. $L_{1.0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ exhibits the highest flow point (13.0 $\\%$) probably due to the covalent cross-linking and stable hydrophobic clusters. In contrast, $L_{0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ exhibits the lowest flow point (1.2 $\\%$) due to the lack of covalent cross-linkages and few coordination bonds. The $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ have moderate flow points (2.6-3.8 $\\%$) compared to $L_{0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ and $L_{1.0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ (Figure 7d). The multi-branched chain segments of hyperbranched structure could improve the movement ability of polymer chain segments, $^{[17]}$ facilitating the formation of hydrophobic domains and coordination bonds simultaneously. As a result, the hyperbranched PCL crosslinked hydrogels have the optimized ratio of covalent/noncovalent cross-linking and moderate network rigidity. Especially, the $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{01}$ hydrogel with excellent mechanics can be obtained by adjusting the DS value to achieve the optimal covalent/non-covalent cross-linking balance.\nThe incorporation of dynamic and reversible physical interactions, that is, hydrophobic domains and coordination interactions, endows $A_{x}PCL_{y}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels with an effective energy dissipation capability. Taking $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels as examples, the dissipation energy of the hydrogels was investigated by loading-unloading measurements, and the effect of hyperbranched structure on the energy dissipation capability was evaluated (Figure 8a and Figure S20, Supporting Information). Successive cyclic tensile loading-unloading tests of $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogels with\nincreased strain from 50 $\\%$ to 300 $\\%$ were performed without waiting time. Increased hysteresis loops indicate a gradually increased degree of damage to the internal network structure preceded by macroscopic fracture. The overlapped regions between any adjacent hysteresis loops are observed, which also indicates the good self-recovery ability of hydrogels. The ratio of dissipated energy (U) to fracture energy(W) varies as the strain increases (Figure 8b). Under a small strain (0-100 $\\%$), the value of U/W significantly increases as the strain due to the gradual damage of the network structure. At this stage, the dissociation of the hydrophobic domain happens to dissipate energy. As the strain further exceeds the yield point (100 $\\%$), the fracture of strong metal coordination interactions and disentanglement of polymer chains are mainly responsible for energy dissipation (Figure 8g). U/W gradually decreases as the increased strain, which may be due to the hysteresis in the re-coordination of $Fe^{3+}- COO^{-}$ and the re-construction of the hydrophobic domains. Moreover, the DS value also affects the cyclic tensile performance of the hydrogels. As shown in Figure 8b. the U/W increases as the DS decreases from 1 to 0.33. This is because the lower chemical cross-linking density allows the transfer of more load to the physical cross-linking interactions. However, when the DS value is 0, meaning there is no chemical cross-linking in the networks, the dissipation capacity is the lowest of the others. The low content of $Fe^{3+}$ in the hydrogel should be responsible for this phenomenon.\nThe self-recovery ability of the hydrogel was then systematically explored. Figure 8c and Figure S21 (Supporting Information) show the ten successive loading-unloading tests of $A_{x}PCL_{10^{-}}G_{0.1}$ hydrogels at a strain of 200 $\\%$. The first loading-unloading curves show an apparent hysteresis loop with a larger dissipated energy. The hysteresis loops after the first loading-unloading tests have a negligible change, demonstrating the good elastic resilience of the hydrogels. The dissipated energy exhibits a significant drop after the first cycle and reaches an equilibrium value (Figure 8d). The tendency depends on the dissociation of metal coordination bonds and hydrophobic domains during the first loadingunloading process, and these dynamic interactions cannot reform immediately due to the viscoelasticity of polymer networks. After a sufficient relaxation time, the elasticity of the hydrogel could be recovered depending on the elastic retraction of strong cross-linkers and the reformation of broken weak cross-linkers. The hysteresis ratio and residual strain of $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogel for different waiting times after the first loading-unloading cycle are shown in Fig-\nure 8e-f. The hysteresis ratio gradually increases and the residual strain decreases as the waiting time increases(Figure 8f). The significant hysteresis is closely related to the slow recombination of metal coordination bonds and hydrophobic associations during the unloading process. It is observed that the $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogel shows almost the same loading-unloading curve as the original sample at the waiting time of $60 \\space \\min$ ,achieving an excellent recovery performance of the residual strain (0.1 $\\%$) and hysteresis ratio (98 $\\%$, Figure 8e). This speed of self-recovery is faster than that of many other tough hydrogels. $^{[13a,18]}$ The excellent self-recovery ability can be attributed to the synergistic action of two dynamic physical cross-linkages (hydrophobic domains and metal coordination bonds) in the hydrogel network, which are of great significance for the hydrogel sensors with ultra-long service life. Interestingly, during the cyclic loading-unloading tests, the residual strain of the $A_{0.67}PCL_{10^{-}}G_{0.1}$ hydrogel was always lower than others and exhibited higher hysteresis energy (Figure 8f). We conclude that this should be due to that the hyperbranched PCL with moderate DS can optimize the network architecture and enable preferable recovery capacity. 1) The moderate DS can reduce the chemical cross-linking density of the network and improve the recovery performance of the network under the action of external forces; 2) it is helpful to produce the superior synergistic effect of the physical interactions(hydrophobic domains and metal coordination bonds) to dissipate energy. All the above results clarify the moderate degree of acrylate substitution to induce extreme toughening and excellent fatigue resistance of the $A_{x}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ hydrogel.\nStrain Sensor for Monitoring Various Human Motions\nThe PCL cross-linked hydrogels should exhibit excellent electrical conductivity due to $Fe^{3+}$ and $Cl^{-}$ presence in the networks. $^{[20]}$ Under deformation, changes in channels and lengths of ion transport result in changes in conductivity, allowing the hydrogels to be used as a strain sensor. The strain sensitivity is an important parameter for the strain sensor which represents the responsibility for various deformations. Here, the influence of the topological structure of the macro-cross-linker on the strain sensitivity was also investigated. As shown in Figure 9a, the $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ with moderate DS value exhibits higher sensitivity than the\n$L_{1.0}$ PCL $-G_{0.1}$ and $A_{1.0}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ under the tensile mode, which should be due to the most uniform microphase separation microstructure of $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}.$ This nanostructure is fragile and vulnerable and is easily destroyed under deformations, leading to a significant change in conductivity. Moreover, the ionic interaction in $A_{x}PCL_{10}-$ $G_{0.1}$ ensures their outstanding anti-freezing nature. As shown in Figure S22 (Supporting Information), the crystallization temperatures of all the hydrogels were below $-20 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ offering the possibility of operating well in lowtemperature environments. These features make the hyperbranched PCL cross-linked hydrogels potentially applied for flexible sensors under various conditions.\nWe also demonstrated a simple strain sensor working with monitoring human body movement in real time that requires both good conductivity, high sensitivity, and excellent mechanical properties of hydrogels. As shown in Figure 9c, stable sensing performances of $A_{0.67}PCL_{10}-G_{0.1}$ is observed under both small strains (1$\\%$,5$\\%$,10$\\%$,20$\\%$. and 30 $\\%$) and large strains (50 $\\%$, 100 $\\%$, 150 $\\%$, 200 $\\%$, and 250 $\\%$). Signal differences of the relative change in resistance $(\\Delta R/R_{0})$ were observed clearly under all the strains. Gauge factor (GF), a parameter to quantitatively express the sensitivity of a strain sensor, was divided into three stages according to strain for the hydrogel. GF was calculated to be 1.42,2.32, and 3.35 in the strain range of 0120$\\%$,120-300$\\%$,and300-500$\\%$,respectively(Figure9d). Generally, the maximum skin deformation under diverse human motion was about 75 $\\%$, thus the hydrogel sensor exhibited reliability for the application in human motion monitoring. Based on the above results, the hydrogel exhibited unique flexibility, high sensitivity, and a wide working range. The hydrogel sensor can be utilized as a wearable sensor for monitoring human activities in realtime, including finger, wrist, and the subtle movements of facial expression changes (such as frowning and smiling). Figure 9e depicts the relative change in resistance gradually increased in real-time as the finger bent from the straight state $(0^{\\circ})$ to $30^{\\circ}, \\space 60^{\\circ},$ and $90^{\\circ},$ and the bending motions of the fingers could be precisely detected in successive bending-straightening cycles. Moreover, Figure 9f exhibits an obvious change in resistance when the hydrogel strain sensors adhere to the wrist. In addition, in Figure 9g, the hydrogel could also detect facial expression changes (such as frowning and smiling). These results demonstrated that the hydrogel strain sensor could precisely track the vigorous motions, which possessed stable, fast responsive, and highly sensitive, and could be explored as a potential candidate to monitor human sports.\nConclusion\nIn this study, a hyperbranched PCL was synthesized and used as a macro-cross-linker to fabricate a novel family of strong and ultra-tough ionic hydrogel. Compared to the linear PCL, hyperbranched PCL has endowed the hydrogel with excellent mechanical properties, including high strength, superior stretchability, and outstanding toughness. The acryloyl terminal groups provided the covalent crosslinks, and the hydrophobic domains of PCL and $Fe^{3+}$ -COO- coordination interactions served as the non-covalent cross-links. By tailoring the topological structure of the hyperbranched PCL, the optimal balance of covalent/noncovalent cross-linking could be obtained, resulting in a uniform microphase separation structure and excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, the ionic hydrogel also showed outstanding anti-swelling and anti-freezing abilities due to the strong binding strength between carboxylic acid and $Fe^{3+},$ allowing it to be applied to the strain sensor. It is worth noting that the hyperbranched PCL cross-linker with moderate DS value also endowed the hydrogel with higher sensitivity than that of linear PCL. As a strain sensor, the hydrogel could monitor multiple ranges of human activity such as joint movements (finger, wrist) and small deformations (smile and frown). In summary, the introduction of a hyperbranched macro-cross-linker into ionic hydrogels can balance excellent strength, ultra toughness, outstanding antiswelling, anti-freezing, and high strain sensitivity properties, exhibiting the optimal overall performance among all ionic hydrogels reported to date (Figure 9h). This strategy provides new insights into the fabrication of high-performance hydrogel materials via designing and developing novel network architectures, which will expand the scope of hydrogel applications.\nAssociated Content\nSupporting Information.

Quantifying the quick dynamic changes in key parameters during the early course of ferroptosis can provide insights for understanding the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis and help the development of therapies targeting ferroptosis. However, in situ and quantitatively monitoring the quick responses of living cancer cells to ferroptosis at the single-cell level remains technically challenging. In this work, we selected HuH7 cells (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells) as a cell model and Erastin as a typical ferroptosis inducer. We utilized scanning electrochemical microscopy(SECM) to quantitatively and in situ monitor the early course of ferroptosis in HuH7 cells by characterizing the three key parameters of cell ferroptosis (i.e., cell membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and the redox state). The SECM results show that the membrane permeability of ferroptotic HuH7 cells continuously increased from 0 to $8.1 \\times 10^{-5}ms^{-1},$ the cellular oxygen consumption was continuously reduced by half, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ released from the cells exhibited periodic bursts during the early course of ferroptosis, indicating the gradually destroyed cell membrane structure and intensified oxidative stress. Our work realizes, for the first time, the in situ and quantitative monitoring of the cell membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ level of the early ferroptosis process of a single living cancer cell with SECM, which can contribute to the understanding of the physiological process and underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis.\nINTRODUCTION\nCancer as a serious threat to human health brings a huge medical burden to the world. $^{1}$ In recent years, new cancer therapy strategies and antitumor drugs have shown great potential to change the landscape of cancer treatment. $^{2,3}$ Ferroptosis, a concept first proposed in 2012, is a nonapoptotic regulatory programmed cell death caused by the toxic accumulation of iron-dependent polyunsaturated phospholipid(PUFA) peroxidation on cellular membranes. Because of its unique mechanism, ferroptosis as a new antitumor therapy strategy has attracted significantly increasing attention in the biology, medicine, and pharmacy fields in the past decade. The role of ferroptosis in oncology and tumor therapy has been extensively studied with substantial progress, $^{5-10}$ based on which several ferroptosis inducers(FINs)(e.g.,Erastin, ML162, and FIN56) have been developed and show great application potential in cancer therapy, especially jointly use with conventional therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy) $.^{11,12}$ However, rapid determination of the sensitivity of cancer patients to ferroptosis-inducing therapies remains a challenge, which can be solved by quantifying the key parameters of ferroptosis during its early course. Therefore, it is of great importance to characterize the early response of cancer cells to ferroptosis-inducing therapies, which would promote the development of new FINs and individualized ferroptosis-induction therapy.\nIn the initial steps of ferroptosis, ferrous iron ( $Fe^{2+})$ reacts with $H_{2}O_{2}$ to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH'), which attacks polyunsaturated phospholipids on the plasma membrane and generates lipid radicals $(L^{\\cdot}).$ Then, $L^{\\cdot}$ reacts with $O_{2}$ and produces the phospholipid peroxyl radical(LOO'), which abstracts hydrogen from another PUFA, forming phospholipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) $.^{13,14}$ Finally, cell membrane integrity is lost and ruptured, leading to ferroptosis. Thus, cell membrane integrity, respiratory activity, and the redox state are the three key parameters of ferroptosis, the characterization of which can directly reflect the cell damage state during the ferroptosis process. $^{15}$ In addition, cancer cells exhibit a high level of cellular heterogeneity, which is a determining factor in the therapy efficacy including ferroptosis. In situ and quantitatively monitoring the changes\nACS Publications\n1940\nArticle\nin the three parameters of the ferroptosis process at a singlecell level is of great significance for evaluating the FIN efficacy on cancer cells and developing potential FINs. $^{16-18}$ However, the common methods for characterizing these parameters, such as the dead/live cell staining technique for detecting cell membrane permeability and oxygen/reactive oxygen species(ROS)-sensitive fluorescent probes for measuring oxygen and $H_{2}O_{2}$ levels, are performed on immobilized cells in an invasive manner, which cannot satisfy the need of in situ, real-time, and continuously monitoring the rapid changes of the key parameters during ferroptosis. $^{19-22}$ Therefore, there is still an unmet need for a method that can quantitatively and in situ monitor the dynamic changes in cell membrane integrity, respiratory activity, and the redox state in the ferroptosis process in a noninvasive way.\nScanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) uses an electrochemical scanning probe microscope with a $\\mu m/$ nmsized electrode as its probe to record various charge transfer processes around cells. $^{23-26}$ Due to the advantages of high temporal and spatial resolutions and sample contactless scanning properties, SECM has been used to in situ monitor a variety of parameters of cancer cells at a single-cell level and in a noninvasive manner. $^{27-32}$ For example, the membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and ROS level of cancer cells were quantitatively measured by SECM using [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ , oxygen, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ as the redox mediators in the SECM system. $^{29,30,33-37}$ However, in previous studies, $^{29,30}$ when applying the constant potentials of oxygen reduction and $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation/reduction at the SECM probe, the continuous depletion of oxygen and $H_{2}O_{2}$ around cells occurred, which would perturb the normal cellular physiological microenvironment and thus influence cell function. Recently, He's group developed a programmable pulse potential mode of SECM, $^{38,39}$ which can avoid continuous oxygen and other redox mediator consumption by the SECM probe, thus realizing the characterization of multiple targets during a single process. Therefore, SECM with a programmable pulse potential mode can be an appropriate method to in situ monitor the dynamic changes in membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ levels of single cancer cells under ferroptosis, which, however, has not been reported yet.\nIn this work, to quantitatively monitor the dynamic process of ferroptosis in single living cancer cells, we selected HuH7 cells as the cancer cell model and Erastin as the ferroptosis inducer. We examined the incubation time and dosedependent ferroptosis state of HuH7 cells under Erastin treatment by the measurement of cell viability, ROS, lipid peroxide, and glutathione (GSH) contents, cell membrane permeability, and dead/live staining. Then, we applied SECM with a feedback mode and a programmable pulse potential mode for in situ monitoring of the dynamic changes in the cell membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and redox state of HuH7 cells under Erastin treatment (Figure 1). Our study achieves, for the first time, in situ and quantitative monitoring of the changes in the cellular membrane lipid peroxidation, respiration rate, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ release during the early ferroptosis process using SECM. We also demonstrate that SECM, as a powerful method for the characterization of the cellular ferroptosis process, can provide the in situ and quantitative data of the key parameters in the early ferroptosis process, which can contribute to further understanding the ferroptosis mechanism.\nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nChemicals and Materials. The Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8) was obtained from Beyotime (China). BODIPY 581/591 C11 and live/dead kits were obtained from Thermo Scientific. The ROS/superoxide detection assay kit was purchased from Abcam (U.K.). The microreduced glutathione(GSH) assay kit, Leibovitz's L-15 cell culture medium, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Solarbio Science \\& Technology(China). High-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HG-DMEM), penicillin/streptomycin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and trypsin were obtained from Gibco. Hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride ([Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3})$ was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) was bought from Aladdin Reagent(China). Erastin was obtained from MedChemExpress(China). A Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., resistivity $>18.2 \\space M \\Omega)$ was used to prepare the aqueous solutions used in this study.\nCell Culture and Dead/Live Staining. The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line HuH7 was purchased from the cell bank of the Shanghai Institute of Life Sciences (China) and cultured in HG-DMEM supplemented with 10$\\%$ FBS. For dead/live staining, HuH7 cells were inoculated on a confocal Petri dish at a density of $1 \\times 10^{4}$ cells $cm^{-2}$ and cultivated for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and $10 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin for 2.5 h; then, Calcein AM (1:2000) and ethidium homodimer-1 (1:1000) were utilized to incubate the cells for 20 min at $37 \\space ^{\\circ}C$ in the dark. Finally, the cells were photographed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U, Japan).\nMeasurements of the Cell Viability and ROS, Lipid Peroxide, and GSH Contents of HuH7 Cells under Erastin Treatment. For measurements of cell viability and ROS and lipid peroxide contents, HuH7 cells were inoculated in 96-well plates $(1.5 \\times 10^{4}$ cells per well). For measurements of intracellular GSH content, HuH7 cells were inoculated in six-well plates $(1 \\times 10^{6}$ cells per well). Then, the cells were treated with $10 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin for 0,1,2,3,4,and 5 h. The cell\n1941\nArticle\nviability and contents of ROS, lipid peroxides, and GSH were detected with the CCK-8, ROS/superoxide detection assay kit, BODIPY 581/591 C11, and microreduced GSH assay kit, respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. A multifunctional microplate reader (TECAN SPARK 10 M) was used to record the absorbance and fluorescence intensities of the cells.\nElectrochemical Measurements. A three-electrode system, including a $10 \\space \\mu m-$ in-diameter Pt electrode as the working electrode (WE), a 0.6 mm-in-diameter Ag/AgCl wire as the reference electrode (RE), and a 0.5 mm-in-diameter platinum wire as the counter electrode (CE), was used for all of the electrochemical experiments in this work. The cyclic voltammograms of Erastin were recorded in PBS containing $2 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin and 1 mM [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}/1$ mM FcCOOH with scan rates of $0.01 \\space V \\space s^{-1}.$ The SECM experiments were conducted with an SECM instrument (ElProScan, HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Harvard Bioscience Inc.) integrated on a fluorescence microscope (Olympus-IX53, Olympus Co., Ltd., Japan) using a $10 \\space \\mu m-$ in-diameter Pt electrode (RG=2,RG is the ratio between the radius of the surrounding glass sheath and the radius of the Pt metal disk of the electrode) as the SECM probe. A heated incubator was combined with the SECM system to maintain the temperature of the culture medium around HuH7 cells at $37.0 \\pm 0.1^{\\circ}C$ during SECM measurements. Then, the serum-free L-15 medium containing 0.5mM[Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ or0.5mMFcCOOHwasusedasthe culture medium in the SECM experiments. The distance between the SECM probe and the bottom of the Petri dish was determined via the recorded probe approach curve to the Petri dish surface. To determine the highest point of the HuH7 cell. the SECM probe was first placed about $25 \\space \\mu m$ above the Petri dish bottom and moved to the cell surface with the help of the optical microscope. Then, the SECM probe approached the cell surface, lifted by another $5 \\space \\mu m,$ and then moved to the cell edge. Finally, the two-dimensional (2D) scanning of SECM was performed above the cell to acquire the SECM images of cell topography; then, the highest point of the HuH7 cell was obtained.\nFor measuring the cell membrane permeability of HuH7 cells during the ferroptosis process (Figure 1B), the SECM probe biased at -0.35 V was first positioned about $25 \\space \\mu m$ above the highest point of the cell. Then, the SECM probe was approached to the highest point of the cell with an approach speed of $0.5 \\space \\mu m \\space s^{-1}.$ The SECM approach curves to the HuH7 cell were recorded at 0,30,60,90,120,and 150min, respectively, after Erastin treatment.\nFor characterizations of the respiration activity and topography of HuH7 cells (Figure 1C), the SECM probe was first placed about $2 \\space \\mu m$ above the highest point of the cell. Then, a set of programmable pulse potentials, including 0.0V(0-100 ms),0.5V(100-400ms),0.0V(400-700ms),-0.6V(700-1000ms), and 0.0V(1000-1200ms), were applied to the probe in turn (Figure S1A). The constant height mode of SECM was applied to scan the HuH7 cells with a scanning area of $100 \\space \\mu m \\times 100 \\space \\mu m$ and a scan rate of $5 \\space \\mu m \\space s^{-1}.$\nFor continuously monitoring the $H_{2}O_{2}$ released from HuH7 cells after adding Erastin (Figure 1D), the SECM probe was first positioned $2 \\space \\mu m$ above the highest point of the HuH7 cell; then, the current-time curves were recorded by applying the programmable pulse potentials of 0.0V(0-350ms),0.65V(350-650ms), and 0.0V(650-1000ms) at the SECM probe(Figure S1B).\nSECM Theoretical Model. COMSOL Multiphysics software (v5.5, COMSOL Inc., Sweden) was applied to build the SECM 2D axisymmetric model with the symmetry plane through the centers of the Pt electrode and the cell (Figure 2A). The radius and height of the cell model were defined as 20 and $9 \\space \\mu m,$ respectively, which are the averages of the radii and heights of the randomly selected 50 cells (Figure S2). The radii and heights of the HuH7 cells after Erastin treatment within 150 min were also characterized by the inverted optical microscopy and SECM (Figures S3 and S4), which did show obvious changes in cell topography and heights after exposure to 2 mM Erastin (for details, see the Supporting Information). The model geometry was meshed, and the size of the mesh around the Pt disk of the electrode and the cell membrane was finely divided (Figure 2B).\nAccording to the previously reported method, 28 the bulk solution and the cell's interior are defined as the two key domains. The diffusion of [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ in both domains follows Fick's second law (eqs 1 and 2).\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{B}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial t}=D(\\frac{\\partial ^{2}C_{B}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial r^{2}}+ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial C_{B}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial r}$$\n$$+ \\frac{\\partial ^{2}C_{B}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial z^{2}})$$\n(1)\n1942\nArticle\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{C}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial t}=D(\\frac{\\partial ^{2}C_{C}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial r^{2}}+ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial C_{C}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial r}$$\n$$+ \\frac{\\partial ^{2}C_{C}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial z^{2}})$$\n(2)\nwhere $C_{B}$ and $C_{C}$ are the concentrations of [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ in the bulk solution and in the interior of the cell, r and z are the axisymmetric coordinates in the model, t is the time, and D is the diffusion coefficient of [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ in Leibovitz's L-15 culture medium at $37 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}(D=1.31 \\times 10^{-5}cm^{2}s^{-1}$ in this case).\nThe cell membrane is defined as the flux boundary (eqs 3 and 4); the permeability coefficient $(P_{m})$ is defined as the velocity of the molecule ([Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ in this case) across the cell membrane, which is controlled by the concentration difference in the two domains.\n$$f_{in}=P_{m}(C_{B}-C_{C})$$\n(3)\n$$f_{out}=P_{m}(C_{C}-C_{B})$$\n(4)\nThe concentration of [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ around the Pt disk surface is obtained by integrating the flux into the Pt disk surface at each simulated electrode position. The current on the Pt disk surface is calculated by eq 5.\n$$i=2 \\pi nDF \\int _{0}^{a}r[ \\frac{\\partial C_{B}(r, \\space z, \\space t)}{\\partial z}]dr$$\n(5)\nwhere n is the number of electrons transferred (n=1 in this case), a is the Pt disk radius of the electrode $(a=5 \\space \\mu m$ in this case), and F is the Faraday constant (96 485 Cmol $L^{-1}).$ By adjusting the probe-cell distance and the $P_{m}$ value, the theoretical approach curves with different $P_{m}$ values were obtained.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nErastin-Induced Ferroptosis in HuH7 Cells. Erastin directly inhibits the activity of cystine/glutamate antiporter(system xc-) and the synthesis of reduced GSH, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses and ferroptosis.40 In this work, to determine how HuH7 cells respond to Erastin and when the cell state changes most under Erastin treatment, we examined the cell viability and ROS, lipid peroxide, and GSH contents of the HuH7 cells at 0,1,2,3,4,and 5h after treatment with Erastin. First, we examined the GSH level and cell viability of HuH7 cells under Erastin treatment using the CCK-8 and microreduced GSH assay kit, respectively. From Figure 3A,B, we can see that after adding $10 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin to the cell culture, the GSH level and cell viability of HuH7 cells significantly decreased by $49.67 \\pm 3.28$ and $40.95 \\pm 4.95 $\\%$$ in 0-3 h and then decreased by $15.02 \\pm 2.96$ and $5.22 \\pm 3.33 $\\%$$ in 3-5 h, indicating that the cellular GSH synthesis was significantly blocked and the cell damage state was exacerbated within 3 h of Erastin treatment. Moreover, when the synthesis of reduced GSH was blocked, the excessive ROS would intensify the Fenton reaction to generate a large number of free radicals, which induced PUFAs peroxidation on the cell membrane and ferroptosis. $^{41}$ We thus characterized the changes in the intracellular ROS and lipid peroxide levels during ferroptosis using the fluorescent labeling method. From Figure 3C,D,we can observe that the contents of ROS and lipid peroxides increased sharply by $56.97 \\pm 1.46 $\\%$$ and 11.18 $\\pm \\space 0.64-$ fold during 0-3 h, respectively. Additionally, we also characterized the membrane permeability using propidium iodide (PI), a nucleic acid dye unable to pass through the intact cell membrane (Figure 3E). The fluorescence intensity of HuH7 cells increased rapidly in 0-3 h and then increased slowly in 3-5 h, indicating that the cell membrane permeability changed most in 0-3 h after adding Erastin and then became stable in 3-5 h. From the above experimental results, we can obtain that the ferroptosis process of HuH7 cells was significantly aggravated within 3 h after Erastin treatment, which was consistent with the previous reports 40,42\n1943\nArticle\nand could provide the time reference for the following SECM measurements.\nDue to cell heterogeneity, it is of great value to distinguish the responses of single cells to Erastin. Moreover, drug efficacy is usually affected by close contact with the cancer cell.43 Therefore, the dynamic process of ferroptosis needs to be monitored at the single-cell level for a deeper understanding of the pathological process of ferroptosis. To obtain a suitable Erastin concentration for monitoring the ferroptosis process of HuH7 cells at the single-cell level, we inoculated the HuH7 cells on a Petri dish with a density of $1 \\times 10^{4}$ cells $cm^{-2}$ and then added Erastin with different concentrations of 0,2,4,6,8, and $10 \\space \\mu M$ to the cell culture. From the fluorescence images of the cell dead/live staining in Figure 3F, we can see that adding $2 \\mu M$ Erastin into the cell culture did not cause rapid cell death in a time course of 3 h, while adding over $4 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin caused massive dead HuH7 cells. Based on this result, we selected Erastin with a concentration of $2 \\space \\mu M$ as the dose amount for the following SECM experiments.\nNext, we used SECM to in situ monitor the dynamic process of ferroptosis, including the cell membrane permeability, topography, respiratory activity, and redox state of HuH7 cells, using [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3},$ FcCOOH, oxygen, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ as the corresponding redox mediators. Before SECM measurements, to exclude the possible reactions between Erastin and the redox species (i.e., Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}Cl_{3}$ and FcCOOH) in our SECM system, we used cyclic voltammetry to characterize the electrochemical activity of Erastin in PBS containing Erastin and Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}Cl_{3}$ or FcCOOH. From the cyclic voltammograms (Figure S5), we can observe that after adding $2 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin into PBS containing Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}Cl_{3}$ or FcCOOH, there was no significant current change in both the oxidation and reduction processes, indicating that Erastin was neither oxidized or reduced at the Pt electrode nor reacted with Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}Cl_{3}$ or FcCOOH. Therefore, we can use [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ and FcCOOH as the redox mediators to monitor the membrane permeability and topography of HuH7 cells under Erastin treatment in our SECM measurements.\nMembrane Permeability of HuH7 Cells under the Ferroptosis Process Quantified by SECM. The most important features of ferroptosis are the damaged structure and the loss of barrier function of the cell membrane caused by the peroxidation of PUFAs. $^{44}$ Herein, we used SECM with a feedback mode to in situ monitor the dynamic changes in the membrane permeability of HuH7 cells under Erastin treatment. We selected [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3},$ ahydrophilic compound, as the redox mediator in our SECM system and applied the reduction potential of [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}(-0.35V($ vs Ag/AgCl RE)) at the SECM probe. As illustrated in Figure 1B, when the cell membrane is intact, hydrophilic [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ in the solution cannot cross the cell membrane due to the hydrophobic phospholipid layer of the cell membrane. When the cell membrane is damaged,[Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ diffuses across the cell membrane and leads to a probe current change as the probe approaches the cell membrane. From the SECM approach curves to the cell membrane after Erastin treatment, we can extract the cell membrane permeability of HuH7 cells in the ferroptosis process using the theoretical model in Figure 2. Then, we used the $P_{m}$ values to quantify the dynamic change in cell membrane permeability, which can reflect the degree of cell membrane damage during the ferroptosis process.\nThe recorded SECM experimental approach curves to the HuH7 cells after adding $2 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min and the fitted theoretical ones with different $P_{m}$ values are shown in Figure 4A. First, before adding Erastin to the cell culture (i.e., 0 min), the approach curve to the HuH7 cell surface presented a pure negative feedback trend and fitted well with the theoretical curves with $P_{m}=0m \\space s^{-1}.$ It can be due to the fact that the cell membrane remained intact and blocked the diffusion of [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ from the solution to the probe surface, leading to a decreased probe current as the probe approached the cell membrane. In addition, we can also see that there were the characteristics of lipid peroxidation of cells without adding Erastin in Figure 3D, indicating that a low degree of PUFA peroxidation occurred even without adding Erastin, which may be caused by the highly reactive OH produced by catabolism in the cells. $^{6}$ But the $P_{m}=0ms^{-1},$ in this case, indicates that the cell membrane was not damaged without adding Erastin, which can be attributed to the fact that intracellular GSH could remove the excessive lipid peroxide at the cell membrane. $^{13}$\nSecond, after treating HuH7 cells with $2 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin, the probe current of the approach curves to the cell surfaces became higher and presented a less negative trend with increasing the Erastin treatment time compared to that before adding Erastin. The experimental approach curves fitted with the theoretical curves show that after adding Erastin to the cell culture for 30,60,90,120,and 150 min,the $P_{m}$ values increased from 0 to $0.9 \\times 10^{-5},2.7 \\times 10^{-5},4.9 \\times 10^{-5},6.3 \\times$ $10^{-5}$ and $8.1 \\times 10^{-5}\\space m \\space s^{-1},$ respectively, suggesting that more[Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$ flowed across the cell membrane over time and then led to the increased probe current when approaching the cell membrane. That is, the cell membrane became more permeable and lost barrier function after adding Erastin with\n1944\nArticle\ntime. This phenomenon can also be demonstrated by the rapid increase in the lipid peroxide level of HuH7 cells from 0 to 3 h, characterized by the fluorescence method in Figure 3D. From the approach curves to the HuH7 cells treated with only 0.1$\\%$DMSO for different times in Figure 4B, which were used as the control group in this experiment, we can obtain that the $P_{m}$ values increased from 0 to $0.4 \\times 10^{-5}\\space m \\space s^{-1}$ from 0 to 150 min, implying a slight increase in the membrane permeability after treating HuH7 cells with DMSO. However, compared with the results after adding Erastin, DMSO only caused a slight change in the $P_{m}$ value of HuH7 cells, indicating that the change in cell membrane permeability was mainly due to Erastin rather than DMSO. From the plot of the average $P_{m}$ values of HuH7 cells treated with Erastin for different times in Figure 4C, we can see that the membrane permeability increased continuously with time from 30 min, which might be due to the fact that the cell membrane damaged by the depletion of membrane PUFAs and accumulation of lipid peroxides caused the continuous increase of membrane permeability.\nFrom the lipid peroxide level of HuH7 cells characterized by the fluorescence method in Figure 3D, we obtained the degree of PUFA peroxidation on the cell membrane in a cell population and revealed the reason for the damage and permeability change in the cell membrane under Erastin treatment. Compared to the fluorescence results, the changes in the $P_{m}$ values of the cell membrane during ferroptosis obtained from the SECM results in Figure 4C provide in situ and quantitative data on the damage process of the cell membrane of HuH7 cells, which is an important supplement to the traditional fluorescence characterization results of cell membrane permeability. Both fluorescence and SECM characterization results prove that the ferroptosis process is accompanied by the continuous increase in membrane permeability and the structural collapse of the HuH7 cells.\nTopography and Respiratory Activity of HuH7 Cells under the Ferroptosis Process Imaged by SECM. The oxygen consumption rate is an important index of cell metabolism and the mitochondrial function related to ferroptosis. Moreover, oxygen reacts with L. to produce LOO,which is an important part of lipid peroxidation occurring on the cell membrane. $^{45}$ Quantitatively and in situ monitoring the cellular oxygen consumption rate is of great significance for assessing the changes in the mitochondrial function and respiratory chain activity in the ferroptosis process. Herein, we in situ monitored the topography and respiratory activity of HuH7 cells treated with Erastin using the programmable pulse potential mode of SECM with FcCOOH and oxygen as the corresponding redox mediators (Figure 1C). From the recorded oxidation current of FcCOOH and the reduction current of oxygen during positioning the SECM probe to the cell surface, we can obtain both the topography and oxygen consumption information around cells based on the probe current.\nFirst, from Figure 5A, we can see that the FcCOOH oxidation currents decreased when the SECM probe scanned across the cell surface, which can be due to the HuH7 cell blocking the FcCOOH diffusion from the solution to the probe surface, thus leading to the decreased FcCOOH oxidation currents around the cell. And there was a slight increase in the FcCOOH oxidation currents around the HuH7 cell after adding Erastin from 0 to 150 min, which can be due to the fact that FcCOOH diffused across the cell membrane with the increased cell membrane permeability after exposure to Erastin. To check if the cell topography change $\\dot{d}$ after Erastin treatment within SECM experiments of 150 min, we further used an optical microscope to characterize cell topography and SECM approach curves to characterize cell heights, respectively. From the optical microscopic images of HuH7 cells after Erastin treatment in Figure S3, we can see that the cell topography did not show obvious change within 150min. The SECM experimental approach curves to the Petri dish and the HuH7 cell surfaces after adding $2 \\space \\mu M$ Erastin at different times in Figure S4 show that the heights of the HuH7 cells did not obviously change after adding Erastin within 150 min. According to these results, we can confirm that even though there was a slight change in the cell membrane\n1945\nArticle\npermeability of HuH7 cells due to Erastin treatment, the cell topography did show obvious changes during our SECM experiment period, i.e., the topographic parameters of the HuH7 cell inputted in the SECM theoretical model remained stable after adding Erastin for 150 min of the SECM experiment time.\nSecond, since the oxygen reduction current recorded at the SECM probe is affected by both cell topography and oxygen concentration around the cell, the above results ensure that the cell topography will not disturb the oxygen reduction current at the probe in this case. Then, from the images of oxygen reduction currents in Figure 5A, we can see that as the probe scanned across the top of the cell, the oxygen reduction currents decreased, which can be due to the fact that the living HuH7 cells continued to consume oxygen in the solution and thus leading to a decreased oxygen concentration around the cell than in the solution. We can also observe that the oxygen reduction currents above the HuH7 cell increased after Erastin treatment from 0 to 150 min, suggesting that oxygen consumption of the HuH7 cell gradually reduced. To quantify the changes in the respiratory activity of HuH7 cells after adding Erastin, we drew the oxygen reduction current of the horizontal axis above the highest point of the cell and normalized the current by dividing them by the maximum background current. From Figure 5B, we can see that the normalized oxygen reduction current at the highest point of HuH7 cells was 91.1$\\%$ at 0 min (without adding Erastin) and increased to 91.6,92.8,93.2,94.4,and 95.3$\\%$ after adding Erastin at 30,60,90,120 and 150 min, respectively. It suggests a continuous decrease in the oxygen consumption (i.e,, respiratory activity) of HuH7 cells after adding Erastin with time, which can provide direct evidence of the decrease of cellular respiration activity during the ferroptosis process. The possible reason for this phenomenon could be that disruption of the cell membrane system during the ferroptosis process results in a decreased oxidative phosphorylation level of mitochondria, which occurs in the cell membrane system. $^{46,47}$\nThird, to double-check that the decreased respiratory activity was due to Erastin treatment rather than the solvent(DMSO), we also performed the same SECM experiments on the HuH7 cells in the solution by only adding DMSO (0.1$\\%$). From Figure 5C, we can observe that there was no significant change in the SECM images of FcCOOH oxidation (ie., cell topography) and oxygen reduction (i.e., cellular oxygen consumption) and the normalized oxygen reduction currents across the highest point of the cell only increased from 88.7 to 89.9$\\%$ after adding DMSO from 0 to 150 min (Figure 5D). It indicates that the effect of DMSO on the respiratory activity of HuH7 cells could be ignored compared with the effect of Erastin. These results demonstrate that the cell topography remained nearly unchanged within 150 min after Erastin treatment, while the oxygen consumption rate of HuH7 cells under ferroptosis continued to decrease. And we can conclude that although lipid peroxidation on the cell membrane can promote cellular oxygen consumption, the change in oxygen consumption caused by lipid peroxidation is much less than that caused by mitochondria dysfunction in the ferroptosis process. $^{13,45}$ Thus, a decreased oxygen consumption of HuH7 cells after Erastin treatment was obtained by our SECM results.\nH2O2 Secreted from HuH7 Cells under the Ferroptosis Process In Situ Monitored by SECM. $H_{2}O_{2},$ the driver of ferroptosis, participates in the Fenton reaction and produces excess OH', which is the first step of ferroptosis. Previous studies have proven that the $H_{2}O_{2}$ content of cancer cells increased in the ferroptosis process. 48 In our study, the result in Figure 3C also proves that HuH7 cells produced more $H_{2}O_{2}$ after Erastin treatment. However, how the $H_{2}O_{2}$ level changes in real time during ferroptosis remains unclear. Herein, as illustrated in Figure 1D, we utilized SECM with the programmable pulse potential mode to real-time monitor the process of $H_{2}O_{2}$ produced from the HuH7 cells by applying the $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation potential at the SECM probe. In Figure 6\n(red curve), the $H_{2}O_{2}$ released from HuH7 cells presented two stages after adding Erastin. At first, the SECM probe current of $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation significantly increased from 83.5 to 92.1 pA from 31 to 41 min after adding Erastin, then dropped to 85.8 pA in the next 10 min. According to the linear correlation between the current response and the concentration of $H_{2}O_{2}$ in Figure S6, we can obtain that the $H_{2}O_{2}$ concentration released from HuH7 cells increased by $1.36 \\space \\mu M$ from 31 to 41 min and then dropped by $0.98 \\space \\mu M$ from 41 to 51 min. The release of $H_{2}O_{2}$ at the first stage (from 31 to 51 min after adding Erastin) can be attributed to the blocked synthesis of GSH and the cell experiencing a state of oxidative stress. 49 At the second stage (from 51 to 110 min after adding Erastin), the probe current of $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation rose again and achieved a maximum value of 95.0 pA at 62 min, indicating the $H_{2}O_{2}$ concentration released from the HuH7 cell increased by 1.85 $\\mu M.$ It could be due to the fact that the intracellular $H_{2}O_{2}$ released more quickly out from the damaged cell membrane of the HuH7 cell under Erastin treatment. Finally, the $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation current decreased slowly from 110 to 150 min, which can be attributed to the fact that the cell membrane failed to protect the cell due to a continuous increase in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and thus leading to the inactivation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and a decrease in $H_{2}O_{2}$ production. 45 Compared with the fluorescence characterization results of intracellular ROS levels produced by HuH7 cells after being exposed to Erastin in Figure 3C, the SECM results present the dynamic release process of $H_{2}O_{2}$ by the HuH7 cell in real time, which can not only reflect the change in the oxidative stress state of the HuH7 cell but also reflect the real-time changes in mitochondrial activity in the cellular ferroptosis process.. $^{50}$ Similarly, we also performed the same SECM experiment on the HuH7 cell only treated with 0.1$\\%$ DMSO. From the black curve in Figure 6, we can see that the $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation current remained nearly constant within 150 min, indicating that there was no significant $H_{2}O_{2}$ release in the case of only adding\n1946\nAuthors\nYuxiang Zhao - The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049,P.R.China;Bioinspired Engineering and Biomechanics Center (BEBC), Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, P.

These results indicate that cellular $H_{2}O_{2}$ production and release are dynamic processes regulated by both mitochondrial activity and cell membrane integrity in the early ferroptosis process. And the quantitative investigation of the dynamic release process of $H_{2}O_{2}$ from the living HuH7 cell can provide real-time cellular information, which is helpful for investigating the efficacy of FINs on cancer cells.\nCONCLUSIONS\nMonitoring the early response of cancer cells to FINs is essential for rapidly determining the sensitivity of cancer types under ferroptosis-inducing therapy and guiding precise clinical decisions. In this work, we used HuH7 cells and Erastin as the respective cancer cell and ferroptosis inducers. Based on the experimental results of cell viability, ROS, lipid peroxide, and GSH contents, cell membrane permeability, and dead/live staining, we selected Erastin with a concentration of $2 \\space \\mu M$ and a dose time of 3 h to induce ferroptosis in the living HuH7 cells. The dynamic changes in the cell membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and redox state of HuH7 cells were in situ tracked by SECM with a feedback mode and a programmable pulse potential mode using [Ru( $NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3},$ oxygen, and $H_{2}O_{2}$ as the corresponding redox mediators, respectively. The SECM results show that the membrane permeability continuously increased from 0 to $8.1 \\times 10^{-5}m \\space s^{-1},$ the respiratory activity dropped by half and $H_{2}O_{2}$ released from the HuH7 exhibited periodic bursts during the early course of ferroptosis, indicating that the damage to the cell membrane, loss of the mitochondrial function, and disorder of the redox state occur in the ferroptosis process. Our work realizes the in situ and quantitative characterization of the early process of ferroptosis in HuH7 cells for the first time using SECM, which provides information on dynamic changes in the key parameters during the early cellular ferroptosis process. In our future work, we will use SECM to study the properties of different cancer cell types under other FINs in situ, which can provide useful information for developing FINs.\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04179.\nPotential-time waveform of SECM with pulsed potentials, measurements of radii and heights of HuH7 cells, optical microscopic images of HuH7 cells after Erastin treatment within 150 min, SECM measurements of HuH7 cell heights after Erastin treatment within 150 min, cyclic voltammograms of Erastin, and calibration plot of the $H_{2}O_{2}$ oxidation current vs $H_{2}O_{2}$ concentration (PDF)\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Author\nFei Li - The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, P.

In this work, SECM combined with programmable pulse potential method was applied for the first time to achieve in situ and dynamic characterisation of cell membrane permeability, respiratory activity and H2O2 release during the early process of iron death in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and the results of the study can help to understand the biological mechanisms related to the structural damage of cell membranes and the functional status of mitochondria in the early process of iron death.

However, most chemiluminescent nanoprobes suffer from shallow imaging depths and slow clearance from living bodies, which impede their use in clinical settings. We herein report size-transformable nanoreporters (ADN1 and ADN2) that could be activated at disease site by superoxide anion $(O_{2}^{.-})$ to trigger nanostructure disassembly into renal excretable fluorescent fragments as well as chemiluminescence turn-on for crosstalk-free duplex chemo-fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinalysis. In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated $O_{2}^{2^{-}}$ to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620 nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19 h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near-infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red-shifted chemiluminescence at $\\approx 800$ nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug-induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.\nIntroduction\nChemiluminescence imaging which detects photons from chemical reactions rather than real-time light excitation has enabled monitoring of physio-pathological events with superior sensitivity and high signal-to-background ratios(SBRs) in vivo. $^{[1,2]}$ To correlate chemiluminescent output with biological events, luminophores which could undergo a classical chemiluminescent process involving the production and decomposition of unstable cyclic peroxides upon chemiexcitation have been extensively developed. $^{[3,4]}$ Among various chemiluminescent scaffolds (e.g. oxalate esters, luminol and cypridina luciferin analogues, etc.) $,^{[1,2,5,6]}$ Schaap's adamantylidene-1,2-dioxetane provides superior chemical amenability and can be feasibly constructed into versatile activatable chemiluminescent probes through caging the phenol group with biomarker-cleavable moieties. $^{[7-9]}$ Such design has inspired the chemiluminescent detection of an extensive array of pathological biomarkers including reactive species (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite) and enzymes $(e.g. \\space \\gamma -$ glutamyl transpeptidase, cathepsin B, granzyme B), etc. $^{[10-31]}$ Unfortunately, these derivatives commonly face challenges related to short retention time and fast in vivo clearance. $^{[26]}$ Despite attempts to construct adamantylidene-1,2-dioxetane-based nanoprobes through intraparticle doping or self-assembly. their considerable dimensions and hydrophobic compositions on the contrary result in sluggish elimination from living bodies, raising long-term biosafety concerns. $^{[32-36]}$\nIn vivo transformation of nanoparticles into ultrasmall fragments has gained growing attention for its promising prospects in advanced diagnostic and therapeutic applications. $^{[37-40]}$ In particular, biomarker triggered nanostructure disassembly or depolymerization presents a spontaneous and effective approach to synergizing the pharmaceutical benefits of nanoparticles, characterized by prolonged retention at the pathological site, with the advantageous attributes of small molecules such as rapid clearance. $^{[41,42]}$ Such concept has spurred the emergence of a novel generation of chemiluminescent nanoprobes for imaging of pH, ROS, and biothiols. $^{[43-45]}$ However, these nanoprobes predominantly rely on co-nanoprecipitation of hydrophobic components and thus the resulted fragments fail to be effectively cleared through renal filtration. Therefore, the development of activatable chemiluminescent nanoprobes that could be simultaneously disassembled into\nrenal clearable pieces in the face of specific biomarkers remains unsolved. On the other hand, the short half-lives of chemiluminescence hinders its ability to trace its in vivo trajectory or to monitor disease progression over an extended period of time. $^{[46]}$ To address this limitation, crosstalk-free duplex imaging by combining chemiluminescence with fluorescence channels could not only permit long-term fate tracking of nanoprobes but also make possible remote disease monitoring through point-of-care urinalysis. $^{[47,48]}$ However, the construction of nanoprobes that demonstrate both chemo-fluoro-luminescent response and size transformation upon biomarker activation has proven to be exceptionally challenging and demands intricate chemistry design.\nWe herein report the development of activatable nanoreporters (ADNs) with superoxide anion $(O_{2}^{\\bullet -})-$ triggered size-transformation and chemo-fluoro-luminescence response for crosstalk-free duplex imaging of peritonitis, drug induced hepatoxicity and in vitro urinalysis. The representative probe ADN1 consists of four key components $: \\space a \\space O_{2}\\cdot -$ cleavable moiety, a self-immolative linker, a caged chemofluoro-luminophore and a renal clearance unit (Figure 1a). The chemo-fluoro-luminophore is immobilized into one polymeric entity and masked with $O_{2}^{\\bullet -}-$ cleavable trifluoromethanesulfonate group through co-polymerization with engineered self-immolative linkers, followed by grafting renal-clearance units (2-hydroxypropyl) $- \\beta -$ cyclodextrin(HP $\\beta$ CD) onto side chains. The resulted polymers spontaneously assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solution, wherein their luminescence is intrinsically quenched due to the caging of phenol group which blocks electron transfer. In pathological sites (e.g. peritonitis), upregulated $O_{2}.-$ cleaves trifluoromethanesulfonate, thereby triggering handto-hand depolymerization of ADN1 which results in chemiluminescent emission at 620 nm and the release of renal clearable fluorescent fragments (IPCD) for duplex imaging and urinalysis (Figure 1a-c). To amplify and red shift chemiluminescence, ADN1 is further doped with a naphthalocyanine dye (a silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis(trihexyl silyloxide, NCBS) to induce intraparticle chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (iCRET). The optimized nanoprobe ADN2 exhibits bright chemiluminescence at $\\approx 800$ nm and enhanced tissue penetration depth $(\\approx 2$ cm), allowing for ultrasensitive imaging of $O_{2}^{--}$ for early diagnosis of deeply seated diseases such as drug-induced hepatoxicity.\nResults and Discussion\nSynthesis and characterization\nADN1 was prepared through carefully orchestrated series of three main steps (Figure 2a): (i) synthesis of the indoledioxetane luminophore scaffold 10 which feature an azide group strategically positioned on the alkyl chain; (ii) synnthesis of the trifluoromethanesulfonate-caged self-immolative monomer 22 (Figure S1); and (iii) copolymerization of the luminophore scaffold and caged self-immolative monomer followed by conjugation of the alkyne-functionalized $HP \\beta$ CD via click chemistry. Briefly, the key precursor 6 was initially synthesized from 2-bromo-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde 1 through acetalization of the aldehyde group and substitution with a tert-tutyldimethylchlorosilane group on the phenol position to yield precursor 3. In the presence of trimethoxyphosphine, 3 was converted to 5 through phosphorylation and Wittig reaction, which was further transformed to 6 through aldehyde group substitution and deprotection\n(a)\n(1)CH(OMe) $)_{3}$ ,TBAB\\\\MeOH, $n,6h \\\\ \\rightarrow$\nDCM, immidazole .\n(3)P(OMe) $_{3}$ , $TiCl_{4}\\\\$ DCM,rt,8h\n(4) Adamaantanone, LDA THF, $78 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h.$ TBSO、\n(5)BuLi;DMF\\\\THF, $78 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h$\n$CF_{3}$\nOH\nHO\n$CF_{3}$\n$\\frac{H}{q_{2}}= \\frac{F_{2}O, \\space Pyidin}{\\{DCM,t,2h}\\space H_{2}N \\\\(8)\\space BF_{S}M_{S0^{\\circ}OH_{3}M_{eOH}\\\\ 80^{\\circ},8h}$\nMethylene Blue, $O_{2}\\space H_{2}N.$ icebath\n$\\frac{(6)\\space AcONa,EtOH \\\\ 80^{\\circ}C,12h}{Ch}$\n(10) PropyyyyHPBCD,THF\n$N_{3}$\n$H_{2}O$ , $CuHO_{4}CH_{2}n.$\nIPCD-DO\n(8) $BF_{3}\\cdot$ MeOH,Meo\n$OCF_{3}$\n$H_{2}N.$\n-OH\n(11) Tiphosgeee, DCM\\\\ DMAA, $0. \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,1h$\n(9) Methylene Blue,O2,MeOH\nCompound 22,Dimethylamine\nice bath, 1h\n于\n$N_{3}$\n11\n2010\nNH\n$R_{1}=$\n(10)Propynyl-HPBCD,THF, $H_{2}O$ , $CuSO_{4}\\cdot 5H_{2}O$\nsodium ascorrate 0'C,5h\nR11\nADN1\n$R_{2}=$ Hor 2-hydrexypropy or prop-1-yne\n(b)\n(1)HCHO,HCI,ACOH\n$\\frac{(2)AIBN,NBS,Chorbenzene}{110^{\\circ}C,1rh}(3$ NaOH,HCh,H,2h)\n(4)SOCl,MeOH, $0 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,8T$\n(5) $BBr_{3}$ ,DCM,ice bath,6h\n$90 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h$\n12\n13\n!!\n0-1\n$H_{2}N$\n$H_{2}N$\n-OH\n(6)ACONa,EEIOH, $80 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,12h$\n(7) $BF_{3}\\cdot$ MeOH, $\\xrightarrow{MeOH}$\nCompound7\n$80 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,8h$\nsodium ascorbate, $0 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,5h$\n17\n18\n4 IPCD\nreaction. The precursor 6 was then condensed with indole 7 to yield compound 8. Deprotection of 8 resulted in the formation of the corresponding luminophore scaffold 10. This scaffold was then copolymerized with the trifluoromethanesulfonate-caged self-immolative monomer 22. The phenolate dioxetane intermediate was subsequently prepared via [2+2] cycloaddition with singlet oxygen using methylene blue as the photosensitizer.\nThe azide group on the indole was conjugated with the alkyne-functionalized HP $\\beta$ CD via a click reaction, ultimately yieiding the polymeric chemo-fluorophore probe ADN1. Moreover, the monomer probe IPCD-DO was constructed through caging the hydroxyl group of 8 with trifluoromethanesulfonate group and conjugating the azide group with the alkyne-functionalized HP $\\beta$ CD. The chemical structures of the intermediates, ADN1 and IPCD-DO were confirmed by $^{1}H$ NMR and mass spectra. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis revealed that ADN1 contained $\\approx 4$ units of both the luminophore scaffold and caged self-immolative monomer (Figure S2). The activated fragment IPCD was also synthesized (Figure 2b) and characterized. This synthesis involved several steps starting with the preparation of the key precursor methyl 2-formyl-5-hydroxybenzoate 16 through condensation of compound 12 with formaldehyde under the acidic conditions, resulting the formation of phthalide 13. Subsequently, bromination and esterification were carried out using Wohl-Ziegler conditions and sulfoxide chloride in methanol, respectively, to obtain methyl ester 15. Deprotection of methyl ester 15 using $BBr_{3}$ resulted in the formation of the phenol 16, which was then condensed with indole 7 to yield compound 17. Further deprotection of acetylated amine using boron trifluoride-methanol complex led to the formation of compound 18, which was finally conjugated with the alkyne-functionalized HP $\\beta$ CD to obtain IPCD.\nIn vitro characterization\nFollowing spontaneous assembly of ADN1 into nanoparticles in aqueous solution, its in vitro properties were substantially investigated. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that ADN1 had a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 130 nm (Figure S3a). Zeta potential measurement revealed that ADN1 was negatively charged (Figure S4a). The spherical morphology of ADN1 was visualized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Figure 3i). Moreover, no obvious change in size was observed for ADN1 in both phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) for up to 15 days (Figure S3b). Optical characterization of ADN1 revealed the peak absorption at $\\approx 580$ nm, minimal chemiluminescence and a low fluorescence quantum yield of 1.4 $\\%$ in the absence of $KO_{2}$ due to the caged fluorophore and diminished electron donating capacity of the oxygen atom on the phenol(Table S1). However, upon exposure to $KO_{2}$ ,ADN1 exhibited a red-shifted maximum absorption at approximately 610 nm and a 6-fold fluorescence enhancement at 625nm, as well as an 8100-fold increase chemiluminescence at 610 nm (Figure 3a-c). Such remarkable enhancements should be attributed to the cleavage of trifluoromethanesulfonate group by $O_{2}^{\\bullet -}$ and subsequent depolymerization of ADN1 backbone (Figure S1d). This process generates a phenolic dioxane intermediate that spontaneously decomposes to emit photons. The chemiluminescent quantum yield was determined to be $\\approx 0.7 \\space $\\%$ .$ Good linearity between the chemiluminescence signals and $KO_{2}$ concentrations was observed, showing an estimated limit of detection (LOD) of $\\approx 10$ nM (Figure 3d). In addition, the chemiluminescence half-life of ADN1 was as long as 7 min (Figure 3e), making it suitable for in vivo imaging. Negligible luminescence responses were observed towards other ROS and metal ions(Figure 3f), indicating the high sensitivity and specificity of ADN1. Furthermore, TEM showed that the size of ADN1 decreased dramatically to less than 5 nm after the incubation with $KO_{2}$ (Figure 3i). To compare the chemiluminescence amplification effect of ADN1 with that of its monomer probe IPCD-DO, their chemiluminescence signals were recorded with the addition of $KO_{2}.$ Absorbances of ADN1 and IPCD-DO were measured to be identical (Figure S4c), ensuring the equivalent monomer units. The chemiluminescence signal produced by ADN1 was about 4.2-fold higher than that obtained by IPCD-DO (Figure 3g \\& h), indicating the superior signal amplification capability of ADN1.\nRenal clearance studies\nTo investigate the pharmacokinetics of ADN1 and its fragment IPCD, the concentrations of ADN1 and IPCD in the blood were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after a single intravenous (i.v.) injection into living mice. The results showed that the concentration of IPCD in the blood rapidly decreased to 0 $\\%$ injected doses (ID) $g^{-1}$ at 4 h post-injection, while for ADN1, it was prolonged to 24 h post-injection (Figure 4d). The elimination half-life $(t_{1/2 \\beta})$ of IPCD $(\\approx 48$ min) was much shorter than that of ADN $1(\\approx 9h).$ The renal clearance efficiency of ADN1 was determined to be $3.0 \\pm$ 1.2$\\%$ ID after 24 h injection, which was in sharp contrast to $90 \\pm 3 \\space $\\%$$ ID for IPCD (Figure 4e). This should be attributed to its large particle size $(\\approx 130$ nm), which far exceeded the kidney filtration threshold $(\\approx 6$ nm). On the other hand, IPCD was mainly excreted through kidneys due to its high hydrophilicity (distribution coefficient Log D=-10.14) and low molecular weight $(\\approx 2$ kDa) relative to the glomerular filtration molecular weight cutoff $(\\approx 50$ kDa) $.^{[49]}$ Furthermore, the biodistribution of ADN1 and IPCD was evaluated through fluorescence imaging of mice after i.v. injection, where the fluorescence signal of IPCD was mainly recorded in the kidneys, with no obvious signal observed in other organs (Figure 4b and Figure S5a,b). In contrast, ADN1 exhibited liver-oriented accumulation (Figure 4b,c), showing minimal fluorescence due to its intrinsic non-luminescent nature. Furthermore, the absorption, HPLC and mass spectra of IPCD recovered from urine and its as-synthesized form were almost identical (Figure 4f and Figure S6),\nconfirming its minimal in vivo metabolism in mice. Finally, histological staining revealed that both ADN1 and IPCD had high biocompatibility, with no signs of cell death or necrosis observed in the major organs (Figure S5c).\nDuplex imaging and urinalysis of peritonitis\nThe ability of ADN1 for real-time duplex imaging and urinalysis was initially evaluated in a mouse model of inflammation-associated peritonitis. Zymosan (ZMS), a polysaccharide fraction from yeast cell walls, was used as the model drug to induce inflammation through Toll-like receptors 2 or dectin-1 signaling , $^{[50]}$ which triggered the activation of NADPH oxidase and overproduction of ROS(Figure 5a). ZMS was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into living mice at a peritonitis dose (500 mg $kg^{-1}),[51]$ followed by i.p. injection of ADN1 or IPCD-DO at 5 h post-treatment of ZMS. The control group mice were treated with PBS or antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 $mgkg^{-1}, \\space i.p.$ injection) 1 h prior to ZMS administration. Whole-body longitudinal chemiluminescence and fluorescence imaging were conducted concurrently at different post-injection timepoints (Figure 5b). At 1 min post-injection of ADN1, the chemiluminescent signal of ADN1 was detected in the peritoneum (Figure 5c) and was 10-fold higher than that of the control mice, indicating the upregulation of $O_{2}^{.-}$ during the progression of peritonitis. Such an increased chemiluminescence signal was also observed at later 30 min imaging timepoints but decreased to background at 40 min post-\ninjection. At those timepoints, the kidneys were clearly delineated with fluorescence imaging (Figure 5c), indicating that ADN1 was activated in the peritoneum to release IPCD into the kidneys. The fluorescence signals in the kidneys increased at later imaging timepoints due to the sequential depolymerization of ADN1 and excretion of IPCD from peritoneum to kidneys, showing a 3.7-fold signal increase relative to the control mice at 40 min post-injection timepoints (Figure 5e). In contrast, fluorescence signals in the peritoneum showed negligible increments in either ZMStreated mice or the control mice (Figure 5c). Such severely reduced sensitivity of peritoneal fluorescence imaging can be attributed to the fact that IPCD had a relatively short fluorescence emission wavelength $(\\approx 620$ nm), which is subject to strong autofluorescence at such wavelength from chyme and excreta in the intestinal tract. Compared with the fluorescence imaging, chemiluminescence imaging by ADN1 had $\\approx 5.3-$ fold higher SBRs (Figure 5g) due to the elimination of external excitation and minimized tissue autofluorescence. Note that both chemiluminescence and fluorescence signals in NAC-pretreated mice were comparable to the control mice throughout the entire imaging course because the ROS scavenging ability of NAC protected the peritoneum against inflammatory insult (Figure $5c).^{[52]}$ Additionally, the chemiluminescence signals of the monomer reporter IPCD-DO in the peritoneum were 15.1-, 12.3-, 7.7-. 2.9- and 1.7-fold lower than that of ADN1, at 1-, 10-, 20-, 30and 40-min post-injection. Furthermore, the fluorescence of IPCD-DO was undetectable in kidneys. Thus, ADN1 is superior to IPCD-DO for in vivo duplex imaging. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging and biodistribution studies corroborated these findings (Figure S7).\nTo confirm the in situ activation of ADN1 in the peritoneum, immunostaining of peritoneum tissue from mice with different treatments at 5h post-injection of ADN1 was performed and evaluated. The ZMS-treated group displayed strong green and red fluorescence signals assigned to the immunostaining of neutrophils marker Ly6G antibody and ADN1, respectively, indicating inflammatory neutrophils infiltration after ZMS stimulation (Figure S8a). Conversely, control mice and NAC-treated mice exhibited attenuated signals, which were 35-fold and 4-fold lower than those of ZMS-treated mice, respectively (Figure S8b). Furthermore, histological hematoxylin and eosin (H\\&E) staining showed normal tissue morphology at 5 h and 12 h posttreatment of ZMS, but severe necrosis at 24 h post-treatment (Figure S9).\nTo evaluate the translational potential of ADN1, the ability to remotely detect peritonitis via optical urinalysis was evaluated in vitro. The kidney function was first assessed in all groups. No increment in serum creatinine(sCr) or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was observed between groups (Figure 5i), indicating that short-term or low-dose ZMS exposure does not affect kidney function. This ensured the identical renal clearance efficiency of IPCD during the detection period. To correlate urinary signal with $O_{2}.-$ during peritonitis, fluorescence signal was measured for excreted IPCD in urine after injection of ADN1 into mice. A9.3-fold fluorescence enhancement was observed for ZMS-treated mice relative to control mice (Figure 5h), validating that ADN1-enabled urinalysis can monitor peritonitis. Consistent with the real-time in vivo imaging data, the urinary signals were attenuated upon NAC pretreatment. The activation of ADN1 and release of IPCD into urine were further confirmed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectra (Figure S10). Thus, ADN1 not only enables real-time duplex in vivo imaging of peritonitis in living mice, but also permits remote in vitro urinalysis.\nOptimization of chemo-fluoro-luminescent nanoreporters\nDistinct from imaging light in the visible region (400700nm), probes generating NIR chemiluminescence (7001700 nm) possessed improved tissue-penetration depth due to reduced photon scattering and minimal tissues autofluorescence. To amplify the chemiluminescence and shift it to the NIR region, the NIR naphthalocyanine NCBS was doped into ADN1 through co-nanoprecipitation to afford\nwater-soluble nanoreporter termed ADN2 (Figure 6a). Upon specific reaction with $O_{2}^{.-},$ the sulfonate ester is cleaved to induce the formation of high-energy unstable phenolate-dioxetane derivatives. Subsequently, iCRET from the unstable derivatives to the NCBS occurs, resulting in the generation of NIR chemiluminescence. Therefore, ADN2 emits chemiluminescence at $\\approx 800$ nm and represents the first size-transformable NIR chemo-fluoro-luminescent nanoreporter for in vivo imaging.\nThe physical and optical properties of ADN2 were studied in PBS solution. TEM image showed that ADN2 exhibited a spherical morphology with an average diameter of $\\approx 130$ nm (Figure 6f and Figure S11), which was similar to that of ADN1. When exposed to $O_{2}^{\\dagger},$ the fluorescence spectra (Figure 6c) showed that ADN2 had the two emission peaks at 620 and 800 nm, respectively, corresponding to ADN1 and NCBS. The chemiluminescence spectra of ADN2 was consistent with its fluorescence spectra (Figure 6d), showing a red-shifted maximum chemiluminescence to $\\approx 800$ nm. To optimize the chemiluminescence intensity, different doping ratios of NCBS in ADN2 were studied(Figure 6d\\&e). The chemiluminescence at $\\approx 800$ nm increased gradually with an increase in the doping weight percentage of NCBS, eventually saturating at 3.5$\\%$ and decreasing at higher doping ratios. This should be ascribed to the intraparticle self-quenching of NCBS at elevated local concentrations (Figure 6e). These results confirmed the efficient iCRET from ADN1 to NCBS. To compare the penetration depth of ADN2 with ADN1, their chemiluminescence signal was acquired after the addition of $KO_{2}.$ The signal of ADN1 was close to the background noise at a chicken tissue thickness of 1cm, whereas the signal for ADN2 was still visible even at 2 cm thickness (Figure 6g). In addition, the SBRs of ADN2 (365, 312, 226, and 103) were 1.5,2.3,4.3,and8.6-fold higher than that of ADN1(242, 134,52,and12)atchickentissuethicknessesof0,0.5,1.0, and 2.0cm, respectively (Figure 6h). These findings verified that intraparticle doping ADN1 with NCBS effectively amplifies the chemiluminescence and red-shift its emission through iCRET, enabling imaging in deeper tissue depths.\nDuplex imaging and urinalysis of drug-induced hepatoxicity\nThe feasibility of ADN2 for real-time duplex imaging and urinalysis of drug-induced hepatoxicity was conducted in the living mice. Acetaminophen (APAP) is an antipyretic and analgesic drug that has been used as a model drug given its well-established mechanism of hepatotoxicity. $^{[53]}$ Overdosed APAP is metabolized by CYP enzymes to produce N-acetylp-benzoquinone imine, which can deplete glutathione and form toxic protein adducts, leading to increased oxidant stress, the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and finally hepatocyte necrosis (Figure $7a).^{[53]}$ APAP was i.p. injection into living mice at a hepatoxic dosage(300 $mgkg^{-1}).^{[54]}$ The control groups were treated with PBS or antioxidant NAC (10 $mgkg^{-1}, \\space i.p.$ injection) 1 h prior to APAP administration (Figure 7b). ADN2 or IPCD-DO were i.v. injected into the mice at 30 min post-treatment of APAP. Longitudinal chemiluminescence and fluorescence imaging were concurrently conducted at different timepoints after injection of probes (Figure 7c). Following ADN2 injection, the first statistically significant chemiluminescence signal increase in the liver was observed as early as 10 min, which gradually increased over time on APAP-treated mice but not on the control mice (Figure 7d). The signal was 15.3fold higher in APAP-treated mice than in control mice at 40 min post-injection of ADN2, indicating the upregulation of $O_{2}^{.-}$ during the progression of hepatoxicity. In addition. kidneys and bladder were delineated at 10 min postinjection of ADN2. Gradual increase of fluorescence signals in the kidneys and bladder were also observed (Figure 7c), showing a 3.2-fold and 6.7-fold increase, respectively, at 40 min post-injection of ADN2 relative to the control group(Figure 7e, f). These results validated the sequential depolymerization of ADN2 and excretion of IPCD from liver to kidneys. However, both chemiluminescence and fluorescence signals were attenuated in the liver, kidney and bladder for NAC-treated mice, which were 7.5-fold, 2-fold and 1.6-fold lower than those of APAP-treated mice. respectively (Figure 7d,e,f). In comparison, neither chemiluminescence signal in the liver nor fluorescence signal in the kidneys and bladder were observed after injection of monomer reporter IPCD-DO (Figure. S12). This was because highly hydrophilic IPCD-DO was mainly excreted through kidneys and did not accumulate much in the liver. This suggested that ADN2 was superior to IPCD-DO for imaging of drug-induced hepatoxicity in living mice. The SBR of chemiluminescence imaging was 5.2-fold higher than that of fluorescence imaging at 40 min post-injection of ADN2 in the liver of APAP-treated mice (Figure 7g), indicating that chemiluminescence had higher sensitivity than fluorescence for liver imaging. However, due to its short half-life, chemiluminescence is less suitable for imaging of kidneys and bladder. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging and biodistribution studies showed similar results (Figure S13). After confirming the identical renal function for each group (Figure S14a), the signals of urinary IPCD were quantified at 3 h post-injection of ADN2. The fluorescence signals increased by 16 and 1.3 folds for APAP-treated mice relative to the control mice and NAC-pretreated mice(Figure 7h), respectively, thus validating the ability of ADN2-based urinalysis to detect hepatoxicity. The activation of ADN2 and release of IPCD into urine were further confirmed by MALDI-TOF and HPLC spectra (Figure S15). H\\&E staining revealed normal hepatic morphology at 1.5 h and 3 h post-treatment of APAP (Figure 7i and Figure S16), but massive necrosis at 6 h post-treatment (Figure S16). By comparing ADN2-based duplex imaging/urinalysis and plasma/histological assays, we confirmed that the first statistically significant signal change of ADN2-based duplex imaging/urinalysis occurred at least 5 h earlier than both ALT/AST (Figure S14b) and histological assays. This confirms the superiority of ADN2-based duplex imaging/urinalysis for early and sensitive detection of hepatoxicity.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have synthesized size-transformable nanoreporters (ADNs) that could be specifically activated by $O_{2}^{--}$ to trigger chemiluminescence turn-on and nanostructure decomposition into renal clearable fluorescent fragments for duplex in vivo imaging and in vitro urinalysis of inflammation-related diseases. The representative nanoprobe ADN1 exhibited remarkable sensitivity $(\\approx 10$ nM) towards $O_{2}^{\\bullet -}$ along with convertible pharmacokinetics in vivo, permitting earlier diagnosis of peritonitis at least 19 h ahead of gold standard histological tests. Moreover, by doping ADN1 with an NIR dye NCBS to enable iCRET, the upgraded nanoprobe ADN2 exhibited NIR chemiluminescence without compromising brightness, resulting in enhanced imaging depth $(\\approx 2$ cm). ADN2 was successfully employed in a proof-of-concept application for imaging of drug-induced hepatoxicity on living mice. Remarkably, ADN2 outperformed clinically available plasma (serum ALT/AST) and histological assays and detects hepatoxicity at least 5 h earlier, demonstrating its superior efficacy in detecting oxidative stress in deep tissue. To the best of our knowledge, ADNs are the first size-transformable and duplex optical nanoprobes for both real-time non-invasive optical imaging and remote urinalysis. This study thus highlights a modular design of both structural amenability and functional diversity, making it possible to create a versatile nanoprobe library that not only can be used for early diagnosis of various diseases beyond peritonitis and hepatoxicity, but also holds promising prospects for clinical utility.\nAcknowledgements\nJ.H. thanks the National Natural Science Foundation of China(22207130), the Key Research and Development Plan of Guangzhou City (202206080007), National Key R\\&D Program of China (2022YFA0912700), the Sun Yat-sen University Funded Program (2022\\_76220\\_B21127), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(22lgqb35), the introduced innovative R\\&D team project of\"The Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program\"\n(2021ZT09Y544), Guangdong-hongkong-macao research team project of the Guangdong basic and applied basic research foundation (2022b1515130008) for the financial support.

Here, we have determined that an anion-coordinated triple helicate can be solution-processed into a functional thin film by incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by the incorporation of the anion-coordinated triple helicate show multiple optical properties, such as fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, the film has the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in a water system. The successful recognition of $Ch^{+}$ by the film represents the first example of utilizing `aniono'supramolecular architectures for biomolecule detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.\n$C_{\\text{holine is essential for life because it plays a fundamental}}$ role in neurotransmitter synthesis, $^{[1]}$ methyl group metabolism, $^{[2]}$ lipid transport, $^{[3]}$ and cell-membrane signaling as a component of lecithin. $^{[4]}$ Therefore, the synthesis of artificial supramolecular hosts for the detection of choline and its derivatives has aroused much concern. $^{[5]}$ Supramolecular architectures with well-defined cavities are particularly attractive due to they can give rise to spacerestricted properties that are exploitable in host-guest chemistry. $^{[6]}$ However, the employment of artificial supramolecular systems for biomolecule recognition and detection in aqueous systems still have many more challenges, such as poor solubility of the artificial host in aqueous solution, interference from water molecules for biomolecule response because of solvation or strong hydrogen bonds. $^{[7]}$ This is especially evident for anion-coordination self-assembles, in which the high free energies of solvation for anions can drive the assemblies to dissociate. $^{[8]}$\nBut be that as it may, the multiple hydrogen-bonded system may show good biological compatibility, inspiring scientists to develop versatility of the well-defined `aniono' architectures and overcome the problems of their applications in water system. With the exploration in the last few decades, anion coordination shows the ability to serve as driving force for assembling discrete supramolecular architectures even though the coordination features of anions are far less regular than those of transition metals. $^{[9]}$ Diverse anion-coordination discrete $structures^{[10]}$ have been presented and used in stabilization of reactive species, $^{[11]}$ catalysis, $^{[12]}$ encapsulation of specific molecular cargoes, $^{[13]}$ thermal relaxation, $^{[14]}$ and functional gel materiall. $^{[15]}$ Nevertheless, exploiting anion-coordination self-assembles into biological molecule recognition in aqueous solution remains to be explored.\nMixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) formed by combining a polymer matrix and porous fillers are highly advantageous for the chemical industry including gas absorption and separation, $^{[16]}$ purification of volatile organic compounds, $^{[17]}$ molecular recognition, $^{[18]}$ and so on. $^{[19]}$ The synergy between filler and matrix of MMMs may result in improved stability of the supramolecular structures and provide a different microenvironment than that in solution, therefore may be conducive to the realization of detecting biomolecules by anion-coordination systems in aqueous systems. The stability and easy processability of polymethyl methacrylate(PMMA) make it a potential polymer matrix. And the high transmittance of PMMA will reduce the impact on fluorescence and chiroptical measurements. $^{[20]}$\nTo develop an anion-coordination-driven system with multiple chiroptical responses, tetraphenylethene (TPE) will be an ideal building block for the design of anion ligands. This is not only because of their aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics of luminescence but also on account of the chiral rotational conformations that can show CD and CPL signals. $^{[21]}$\nHerein, a $C_{2}-$ symmetric ligand L was synthesized, in which two bis(urea) are attached to a TPE core at the cis\nposition. Three different types of `aniono' helicates(Scheme 1), including $A_{1}L_{1}$ single-stranded helicate (1), $A_{2}L_{2}$ double helicate (2), and $A_{2}L_{3}$ triple helicate (3), were obtained by treatment of ligand L with phosphate anions through adjusting counter cations ([K([18]crown $-6)]^{+}$ , $TMA^{+}=$ tetramethylammonium, $TEA^{+}=$ tetraethylammonium, $TBA^{+}=$ tetrabutylammonium). The anion-coordination triple helicate was supposed to be incorporated into PMMA matrix for the fabrication of functional thin films, which could display multiple optical properties of fluorescence, CD, and CPL by encapsulation of a chiral choline derivative and realize the recognition of choline in an aqueous system.\nThe `aniono' helicates were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into the acetonitrile solution of the corresponding complex. Treatment of ligand L with(TBA) $_{3}PO_{4}\\space($ generated in situ from TBAOH and $H_{3}PO_{4})$ resulted in an $A_{1}L_{1}$ single-stranded helicate (1, Figures S32-\nS33). The double helicate (2) was obtained by treating ligand L with $[K(18-C-6)]_{3}PO_{4}\\space($ generated in situ from 18Crown-6 and $K_{3}PO_{4}).$ Even though the crystal structure of 2 was not obtained with many attempts, the structure of 2 was optimized by DFT (B3LYP/def2svp) (Figure S40). Adjust(TBA) $_{3}PO_{4}$ to (TMA) $_{3}PO_{4}$ or (TEA) $_{3}PO_{4}\\space($ generated in situ from TMAOH or TEAOH and $H_{3}PO_{4})$ generating $A_{2}L_{3}$ triple helicate (TMA $)_{6}[(PO_{4})_{2}L_{3}] \\space(3 \\supset TMA^{+},$ Figure 1a) and(TEA $)_{6}[(PO_{4})_{2}L_{3}](3 \\supset TEA^{+}$ ,Figure1b),respectively.In addition, the single crystals of a $S- \\alpha -$ methylcholine $(G^{s})$ included $A_{2}L_{3}$ triple helicate $(3 \\supset G^{s},$ Figure 1c) was obtained by treatment of ligand L with $[K(18-C-6)]_{3}PO_{4}$ and $G^{S}$ in acetonitrile. $^{[22]}$\n$3 \\supset TMA^{+},3 \\supset$ ,and $3 \\supset G^{S}$ crystallizedinspace group of $P2_{1}/c,R \\bar{3}c,$ and $I4_{1}/a$ (Table S2), respectively. However, the datasets of $3 \\supset G^{S}$ were not good enough to discriminate the absolute configuration of the internal $G^{s}.$ X-ray single crystal structures reveal that $PO_{4}^{3-}$ anions within one triple helicate adopt the same conformation $(\\Delta \\Delta$ or $\\Lambda \\Lambda)$ and each one coordinated with six urea groups via twelve hydrogen bonds (summarized in Tables S3-S5). The guest molecule ( $TMA^{+}, TEA^{+}$ or S-a-methylcholine) was encapsulated inside the cavity of triple helicate through multiple $C-H \\cdots \\pi$ and cation... $\\pi$ interactions (Figure 1d-f). The $PO_{4}^{3- \\cdots PO_{4}^{3-}}$ distance is 9.4 \\text{\\AA}, 9.6 \\text{\\AA}, and 9.8 \\text{\\AA} in 3 $\\supset TMA^{+},3 \\supset$ ,and $3 \\supset G^{S}$ (FigureS34),respectively, attributing to the adaptive of triple helicate to different size of guest molecules. At the same time, the central cavities of $3 \\supset TMA^{+},3 \\supset$ ,and $3 \\supset G^{S}$ were also altered. Besides the encapsulated $G^{S},$ four [K([18]crown $-6)]^{+}$ ions are located at the external of the triple helicate, forming weak interactions with carbonyl groups of the ligands (Figure S35). The torsion angle between the benzene rings and ethylene group of TPE in $3 \\supset TMA^{+}, \\space 3 \\supset$ and $3 \\supset G^{s}$ were measured to be $58^{\\circ},60^{\\circ}$ ,and $72^{\\circ}$ (Figures S36-S38). respectively. The variation of the torsion angles is ascribed to the differences in the host-guest interaction. Inspection of the crystal structures of triple helicates reveal rectangular pores of 4.15-4.45\\text{\\AA} diagonal distances, facilitating the guest molecules exchange (Figure S39).\nIn addition to the solid-state studies, the formation of the `aniono' helicates were also proved in solution. $^{1}H$ NMR spectra were recorded in $CD_{3}$ CN. Compared to the free ligand L, large downfield shifts of all urea NH protons $(^{1}H$ NMR of ligand L was measured in DMSO $-d_{6}$ for solubility reason, Figures S9-S13 and table S1) are observed. indicating strong hydrogen bonds between $PO_{4}^{3-}/ HPO_{4}^{2-}$ and the urea groups. High-resolution ESI-MS further demonstrated the existence of the $A_{1}L_{1}, \\space A_{2}L_{2},$ and $A_{2}L_{3}$ `aniono' helicates, with peak for 1 at m/z 1234.63 vs calculated 1234.63 for [( $HPO_{4})L($ TBA) $]^{-}, \\space 2$ at m/z 1278.05 vs calculated 1278.02 for [( $HPO_{4})_{2}L_{2}K(18-C-6)H]^{2-}$ , $3 \\supset TMA^{+}$ at m/z 1588.71 vs calculated 1588.72 for [( $PO_{4})_{2}L_{3}-$ (TMA) $_{4}]^{2-}, \\space 3 \\supset TEA^{+}$ at m/z 1700.78 vs calculated 1700.85 for [( $PO_{4})_{2}L_{3}($ TEA) $_{4}]^{2-},$ and $3 \\supset TPA^{+}$ at m/z 1812.91 vs calculated 1812.97 for [( $PO_{4})_{2}L_{3}($ TPA $)_{4}]^{2-}, \\space($ Figures S14S18).\nThe structural transformations between the `aniono' helicates have then been studied due to the achievement of\ndifferent structures by altering the counter-cations. Adding $TMA^{+}$ or $TEA^{+}$ into the solution of 1 or 2 generated the triple helicates $3 \\supset TMA^{+}$ and $3 \\supset TEA^{+}$ (Figures S21-S24). respectively. $3 \\supset G^{S/R}$ were able to be induced with the addition of $G^{S/R}$ into the solution of 1 or 2 (Figures S25S28), which is also applicable to choline chloride for the achievement of $3 \\supset Ch^{+}\\space($ Figures S29, S30). Moreover, the double helicate 2 can also be switched to triple helicate 3 by simply adding a base (triethylamine) to change the protonation state of phosphate (from $HPO_{4}^{2-}$ to $PO_{4}^{3-},$ Figure S31), thereby modulating the `aniono' helicates. Meanwhile, $NEt_{3}H^{+}$ ion was encapsulated inside the cavity of triple helicate $(3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}).$ High-resolution ESI-MS further demonstrated the existence of 3 with the peak at m/z 1744.79 vs calculated 1744.66 for [( $PO_{4})_{2}L_{3}K_{2}(18-C-6)_{2}H_{2}]^{2-}$ (Figure S19).\nFluorescence emission spectra of the `aniono' helicates $(\\lambda _{ex}=390$ nm) were performed in $CH_{3}$ CN, exhibiting a maximum at 499 nm for $2, \\space 3 \\supset G^{S/R}, \\space 3 \\supset TMA^{+},$ and $3 \\supset TEA^{+}$ (Figure 2a, quantum yields $(\\varPhi)$ were summarized in Table S8). Among all the phosphate helicates, $G^{S/R}$ included triple helicates show stronger fluorescence emission than the others. This may ascribe to that the encapsulated $G^{S/R}$ is closed to TPE and can restrict the rotation of phenyl rings of TPE.\nThe CD and UV/Vis spectra of $3 \\supset G^{S/R}$ in $CH_{3}$ CN are shown in Figure 2b, the enantiomers with $G^{S/R}$ show the same UV/Vis absorbance curves and mirror-image CD signals. CD titrations were then carried out to explore the complexation of $G^{S/R}$ guests accompanied by structural transformation (Figure S44). Addition of $G^{S}$ or $G^{R}$ (up to 1.0 equiv) into the solution of 2 induced obvious CD signals at the wavelength range 200-500 nm and reached saturation with 0.6 equiv. of the guests. The appearance of CD signal at 350 nm reveals that the chiral transfer from $G^{S/R}$ to TPE unit. The binding constants $(K_{a})$ of $G^{S/R}$ were determined to be $(3.61 \\pm 0.02)\\times 10^{4}$ and $(4.47 \\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{4}\\space M^{-1}$ (Figure S44). respectively.\nWith the anion-coordinated triple helicates in hand, we wonder if a functional thin film could be obtained by incorporation of triple helicate into PMMA matrix. The thin films containing $3 \\supset G^{S/R}$ ( $Film^{3 \\supset G^{S/R}})$ were prepared by drop casting of the acetonitrile solution of $3 \\supset G^{S/R}$ and PMMA on a quartz glass substrate (containing $3 \\supset G^{S/R}\\space 33$ wt $\\%$, see Supporting Information for detailed information). The\nfluorescence emission spectra of the achieved thin films were first measured. Compared to ligand L in solid state, $Film^{3 \\supset G^{S/R}}$ show enhanced fluorescence emission (quantum yields $(\\varPhi)$ were summarized in Table S9). The fluorescence intensities were much stronger than that in solution phase, attributing to the AIE effect of TPE core in L. Mirror-image CD signals of $Film^{3 \\supset G^{S/R}}$ were also observed, just like in solution (Figure 3a). However, the intensity of the peak at 350 nm is stronger than that at 300 nm, which is different from that in solution. The reason may be due to the restricted bond rotation and large dissymmetries that could be attained in bulk solids (such as solid state and aggregates, Figure S43, Table $S7).^{[23]}$ Especially, $Film^{3 \\supset G^{S/R}}$ exhibit positive and negative CPL signals (Figure 3c-d), respectively, which do not display in solution. The reason may be due to the greatly enhanced fluorescence intensity of thin films, in which the dangling phenyl rings of TPE can be further restricted.\nAfter the successful fabrication of thin films with fluorescence, CD, and CPL properties, the thin films that act as functional materials for recognition of target guest was then explored. A triple helicate solution with a weakbonded guest inside the cavity was desired to better realize the exchange of guest molecules. Therefore, $3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}$ was used to prepare a thin film ( $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}},$ containing 3 $NEt_{3}H^{+}33$ wt$\\%$,seeSupportingInformationfordetailed information) for molecule recognition. $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ shows fluorescence emission at 498 nm and the fluorescence intensity kept almost unchanged for at least 5 days (Figure S45). $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ was able to be exfoliated from the substrate, indicating that the thin film is, to some extent, mechanically flexible (Figure S46). The exfoliated thin film can be stable at room temperature for at least one month. In addition, no significant change was observed within 5 days for both the morphology and fluorescence (under 365 nm\nUV light) of the exfoliated thin film being immersed in an aqueous solution (Figure S47). Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) reveal a uniform and flat surface of Film $^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ (Figure S48). A continuous film with no observable pinholes or defects was observed both from the surface and cross section, revealing uniform mixing of $3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}$ and PMMA. The probable reason may be due to the existence of hydrogen bonds between $3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}$ and PMMA. The thickness of the hybrid thin film was measured to be $2 \\space \\mu m$ (Figure S48). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was further performed to analyze the elements of $Film^{3 \\neg NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ revealing the existence of elements of C, N, O, P, and K with uniform distribution (Figure S49).\nEight $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ were prepared in parallel, showing obvious fluorescence emission under ultraviolet light (Figure S50). The thin films were covered with the solvent of a mixture of ethanol and water with different volume ratios(from 1:0 to 0:1) for five minutes and then remove the solvent. Under the volume ratio of 4:1 (water:ethanol), the morphology and fluorescence intensity of $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ show no obvious change. Therefore, the volume ratio of 4:1 was selected for the following tests.\nIn the wake of the selection of solvent, twelve $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ were prepared in parallel for guest molecule recognition. Add $200 \\space \\mu L$ choline chloride ( $Ch^{+})$ solution with different concentrations ( $Ch^{+}$ was dissolved in the mixture solvent of water and ethanol with a volume ratio of 4:1) on the surface of $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ for 5 min, respectively. After removing the solvent, the fluorescence measurements of the thin films were carried out. The fluorescence intensity of the thin films gradually enhanced along with the increasing concentration of choline chloride ( $Ch^{+})$ and reached saturated with 1.0 equiv. of $Ch^{+}$ (the molar ratio to $3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}$ containing in the thin film, Figure 4a). And the detection limit of $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ for $Ch^{+}$ is $20.48 \\space \\mu M$ (Figure S54). Furthermore, $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ is also able to recognize $G^{R}$ (Figure 4b). The variation trend was similar to that for $Ch^{+}.$ However, the CD signal was not observed for the recognition of $G^{R},$ which may be due to the high Gibbs energies of activation for chiral induction in solid state. The responses of $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ to the alkyl ammonium guests( $TMA^{+}, TEA^{+},$ and $TPA^{+})$ were also examined. The addition of 1.0 equiv. of $TMA^{+}, TEA^{+},$ or $TPA^{+}$ resulted in fluorescence quenching (Figure S56). Moreover, competition experiments were conducted by the addition of the\nmixed solution of 1.0 equiv. of $Ch^{+}$ and 1.0 equiv. of $TMA^{+}$ , $TEA^{+},$ or $TPA^{+}$ (Figure S56) to $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}.$ The emission intensity did not increase as much as when $Ch^{+}$ was added alone, but it is still in an enhanced state of fluorescence.\nIn summary, the $C_{2}-$ symmetric ligand L, in which two bis(urea) are attached to a tetraphenylethene (TPE) core, could self-assemble into $A_{1}L_{1}$ single-stranded helicate, $A_{2}L_{2}$ double helicate, and $A_{2}L_{3}$ triple helicate via coordination with phosphate ions by altering the counter-cations. Functional thin films were then obtained by incorporating $3 \\supset G^{S/R}$ into a PMMA matrix, which display multiple optical properties of fluorescence, CD, and CPL. $Film^{3 \\supset NEt_{3}H^{+}}$ can recognize choline and its derivatives in the mixture solvent of water and ethanol with a volume ratio of 4:1. The fabrication of `aniono' helicate incorporated thin film and application of it for biomolecule recognition in aqueous system suggests a simple and generic approach for the design and fabrication of a broad range of anion-coordinationdriven functional materials with multiple chiroptical responses.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91856102,22171023 and 21971210) and the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(2019KJXX-062).\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nData Availability Statement\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nKeywords: Anion-coordination helicates .

However, semiconductors often show the low light absorption, slow charge transfer, and easy recombination of carriers, thus leading to the low catalytic efficiency . In this work , we show facile synthesis of ZnO@TiO2 core-shell nanorods (NRs ) arrays modified with Au nanoparticles (NPs) as the photoelectrode for PEC water splitting. Impressively, the obtained ZnO@TiO2(15 nm)/Au(8 nm) array shows the maximum photocurrent density of 3.14 mA/ $cm^{2}$ at 1.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode(RHE), 2.6 times and 1.7 times higher than those obtained from ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2(15 nm) arrays. The electric-field simulation and transient absorption spectroscopy show that the Au-decorated core-shell nanostructures have an enhanced hot electron generation and prolonged decay time, indicating effective charge transfer and recombination inhibition of carriers. This work provides an efficient preparation strategy for photoelectrodes as well as great potential for the large-scale development of this technology .\nKEYWORDS\nsurface plasmon resonance, energy transfer, transient absorption, hot electron, water splitting\n1 Introduction\nClean and renewable energy technologies are highly desired with increasing global energy consumption, depletion of fossil fuels and severe climate change. To date, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has become a favorable, eco-friendly and renewable energy technology that uses semiconductors to convert clean and abundant solar energy into hydrogen and oxygen [1-6]. However, building nanostructures with the enhanced light absorption and excellent photoelectrocatalytic performance is still a great challenge.\nMetal oxide semiconductors, such as $TiO_{2}$ and ZnO, have been widely explored in the field of optoelectronics because of their easy synthesis, low cost and non-toxicity [7-10]. However, due to the wide band gap, these metal oxide semiconductors are inactive in the visible region, which limits their wide application. Some efforts have been made to improve their photocatalytic performance, such as element doping, tuning their morphology such as nanotubes, nanowires, and nanorods, and forming composite materials such as core-shell structures [11-14]. Among them, the core-shell structures, which can compensate the deficiencies of single materials due to its unique physical and chemical properties[13], have been widely used in the PEC water splitting. Compared with single metal oxide semiconductors, the one-dimensional(1D) core-shell nanostructures have exhibited the enhanced PEC performance due to the significantly increased surface area, better charge transport and separation performance and the low recombination of electron-hole pairs [15-17]. However, the large band gap still exists in ZnO and $TiO_{2}$ based materials, and the total energy conversion efficiency is still very low due to the lack of the ability to absorb the visible light [18,19]. To address above, noble metals such as Au and Ag are introduced to increase the light absorption and stability of the semiconductors. Moreover, by taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the light absorption band can be adjusted to improve the PEC performance and solar energy conversion efficiency [20-29]. Therefore, reasonable design of a plasmonic metal/semiconductor composite photoelectrode is of great importance to enhance the effective solar light absorption and the PEC performance.\nIn this work, we show constructing the Au nanoparticles (NPs) decorated ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell nanorods (ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au) array as the photoelectrode for PEC water splitting. Impressively, the obtained ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8 nm) array shows the maximum photocurrent density of 3.14 mA/ $cm^{2}$ at 1.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than those of ZnO NRs and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ arrays. The electromagnetic field simulation and transient absorption spectroscopy are used to expound the underlying mechanism of the significant\n5825\nenhancement in photocurrent density, promoting hot electron transfer, inhibiting carrier recombination and prolonging the hot electron lifetime, which is conducive to the improvement of PEC water splitting.\n2 Experimental\n2.1 Materials\nZn( $CH_{3}$ COO) $_{2}\\cdot 2H_{2}O(99 $\\%$)$ ,titanium(IV)butoxide $(C_{16}H_{36}O_{4}$ Ti), isopropanol (99.9$\\%$) and $Na_{2}SO_{4}$ were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Zn( $NO_{3})_{2}6H_{2}O \\space(98 $\\%$)$ and monoethanolamine $(C_{2}H_{7}$ NO,99$\\%$) were provided by Aladdin. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT,99$\\%$) was provided by Alfa.2Methoxyethanol $(C_{3}H_{8}O_{2},99 $\\%$)$ was purchased from TCI. Deionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q water purification system. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.\n2.2 Synthesis of ZnO nanorod (NR)\nVertically aligned ZnO nanorods were prepared on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate by a hydrothermal method [30]. The ITO conductive glass was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water. A precursor solution containing 0.6 M zinc acetate mixed with monoethanolamine and 2-methoxyethanol(1:1) was prepared, and then the dense ZnO seed layer was formed by spin coating (2,000 rpm, 15 s). Specifically, $200 \\space \\mu L$ precursor solution was spin-coated onto a 1cm $\\times 2$ cm ITO glass, and then, it was heated at $300 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 15 min in air atmosphere. Finally, the substrate coating with the ZnO seed layer was placed vertically in a reaction vessel with 0.05 M zinc nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) aqueous solution, and then the solution was kept at $92 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 12 h. The ZnO nanorods were rinsed with deionized water or ethanol, dried in an oven for further use.\n2.3 Synthesis of the ZnO@TiO2 core-shell NRs with different shell thicknesses\nTiO2 shells were covered onto ZnO nanorods by sol-gel method[31]. The formation of $TiO_{2}$ was based on the hydrolysis reaction of titanium(IV) butoxide, followed by condensation reaction and high temperature heat treatment to obtain $TiO_{2}.$ The ZnO/ITO samples were placed in a titanium(IV) butoxide solution diluted with isopropanol, and after stirring for 15 min deionized water was added to initiate a hydrolysis reaction. This process was recycled 3 times to obtain TiO2 layers of different thicknesses, and then the sample was heated at $400 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 2 h. The as-prepared samples are denoted as ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (Xnm).\n2.4 Decoration of Au NPs onto ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell NRs\nAu NPs were deposited onto ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ sample by magnetron sputtering. Different Au NPs decorated architectures were obtained by controlling the sputtering time (10, 15 and 20 s). Then, the sample was heated at $400 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 2 h. The as-sputtered Au NPs-decorated samples are denoted as ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (Xnm)/Au(Ynm).\n2.5 Materials characterizations\nThe crystalline structure of the samples was characterized by wideangle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 Xi system. The morphology of the samples was obtained by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, HitachiSU8220, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were evaluated with a transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV (TEM, Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN and Tecnai G2 F20 STWIN). An ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer(Lambda 950) was employed to measure the transmission and reflection spectra of the samples, which was performed with an integrating sphere using a $BaSO_{4}$ plate as the reference. The absorption was calculated by the equation $A(\\lambda)=1-R(\\lambda)-T(\\lambda).$ The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were measured using a NanoLOG-TCSPC spectrofluorimeter with the excitation wavelength fixed at 320 nm.\n2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements\nThe PEC water splitting of different samples was measured by using a CHI 760E (Shanghai Chenhua) with a three-electrode system (the sample as the working electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode) in 0.5 M $Na_{2}SO_{4}$ aqueous solutions (pH = 6.8). In the PEC experiments, the samples were measured under illumination of a Xe lamp (300 W) without or with a ultraviolet (UV) filter (cut-off wavelength 400 nm). The linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of all samples were measured in dark and under light illumination, which revealed an apparent response to light on/off in a potential range from 0 to 1.4 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. The current-time (I-t) curves were measured under light irradiation(light on/off cycles=25s) at an applied potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE. The EIS measurement was carried out covering a frequency of $10^{5}-0.01$ Hz interval using an amplitude of 10 mV at a bias potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurements were performed under a 300 W xenon lamp with the band-pass filters. All the potentials were referenced to RHE according to the following relationship: $E_{RHE}=(E_{Ag/AgCl}+0.059 \\times$ pH+0.197)V.\n2.7 Transient absorption measurements\nFemtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy was performed to measure transient absorption changes (optical density changes, $\\triangle OD$ )[32,33]. A high energy laser pulse (pump) is sent onto the sample, then a second pulse with weak intensity probes the optical perturbation induced by the pump after a variable delay. The laser beam was supplied by amplified titanium: sapphire laser source(800 nm, Coherent) that provided 30 fs pulses with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. This beam having a power of 6 W was split into two parts. The most intense part (4 W) was used as the pump beam after passing through an optical parametric amplifier (Opera solo), which enabled to tune its wavelength over a wide spectrum, while the other weak probe beam was converted into a white-light supercontinuum after focusing on a calcium fluoride crystal. The pump-probe delay control was ensured by a retroreflector mirror mounted on a high-precision mechanical translation stage and set on the probe path. Two photodiode arrays were placed after the imaging spectrometer to measure probe and reference pulses simultaneously, originating from femtosecond continuum(femtosecond white light). The data were plotted as a function of delay time and wavelength by further processing at ExiPro 2.8.6 software. The samples on the ITO substrate were measured through the transmission mode. All measurements were taken with the same energy (10 mW) pump light pulse with wavelengths of 420 and 380 nm under ambient conditions.\n2.8 Electric-field simulation\nThe electric-field intensity simulations were executed by the commercially available finite-element software (COMSOL Multiphysics). The samples were excited by a linearly polarized\n5826\nlight. Each nanostructure was calculated using perfectly matched layers (PML) as the boundary condition for suppressing the noise reflected or scattered from the simulated boundaries. The refractive indexes of Au were utilized from the data of Johnson \\&Christy [34]. The refractive indexes of the ZnO, $TiO_{2}$ and water were fixed to 1.99,2.55 and 1.33, respectively.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Synthesis and characterization of different samples\nFigure 1(a) schematically shows the fabrication process of Au NPs decorated ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell NRs arrays. Firstly, ZnO NRs arrays were prepared by the hydrothermal method [30]. As shown in Figs. S1(a) and S1(b) in the Electronic Supplementary Material(ESM), the ZnO NRs with hexagonal shape were densely and vertically grown on the ITO substrate, and the typical length and diameter of ZnO NRs are about $2 \\space \\mu m$ and 100 nm, respectively. Secondly, TiO2 was coated onto ZnO NRs by the sol-gel method to form a ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core/shell nanorod structure (Figs. S2 and S3 in the ESM) [31]. It can be clearly seen that the thin TiO2 layer was grown uniformly on the surface of ZnO NRs. The thickness and roughness of the TiO2 shell increase greatly with increase in the number of depositions and cycles. When the cycle number is gradually increased up to 1,2 and 3 times, the shell thicknesses of $TiO_{2}$ are 10, 15 and 20 nm, respectively, denoted as ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (Xnm)(X=10,15 and 20). With the increase of TiO2 shell thickness, it is obvious that the formed $TiO_{2}$ layer is rough and not dense enough (Fig. S3 in the ESM). Finally, the Au NPs were deposited on the core/shell NRs array via magnetron sputtering(ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au). Figures 1(b)-1(d) and Figs. S4-S6 in the ESM show the typical SEM and TEM images of the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/Au$ array with the same morphology like ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ after decorated with Au NPs. Moreover, Au NPs were uniformly deposited on the surface of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ NRs array with uniform size distribution. In general, the average sizes of Au NPs are $5.8 \\pm 0.9,8.6 \\pm 1.3$ and $10.9 \\pm 2.1$ nm with different sputtering time (10,15 and 20s), respectively (Fig. S7 in the ESM). In the case of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (15nm)/Au(8nm) sample, the Au NPs have close contact with the TiO2 shell layer, forming a sharp interface (Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)). From Fig. 1(d), the Au NPs have a high-quality lattice, which helps the SPR-excited hot electrons to be transferred from Au to $TiO_{2}[35].$ The elemental mapping images clearly show that the Zn element is concentrated in the nanorod core region, while the Ti element is distributed around the core, forming a shell structure, indicative of the uniform core-shell structure, and the Au element is randomly distributed on the nanorod surface(Fig.1(e)).\nFigure 1(f) and Fig. S8 in the ESM show the XRD patterns of pure ZnO NRs and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ NRs with different shell thicknesses and sizes of Au NPs. Diffraction peaks located at $31.79^{\\circ},34.58^{\\circ}$ and $36.41^{\\circ}$ can be ascribed to (100),(002) and (101) facets of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), demonstrating the good crystal structure of ZnO NRs even after coating $TiO_{2}$ or Au NPs [30,31]. The narrow and strong (002) diffraction peak of ZnO indicates that the ZnO NRs were grown along the c-axis on the ITO substrate with high texture. The elemental composition of the sample was further identified by XPS (Fig.S9 in the ESM), from which elements Zn, Ti and Au can be observed clearly. Furthermore, the doublet peaks of Au $4f_{7/2}(83.7$ eV) and Au $4f_{5/2}$ (87.4 eV) match well with the metallic Au 4f state, which also confirms the formation of the metallic Au NPs [35,36].\n3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties\nThe optical properties of ZnO,ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ ,ZnO/Au and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au samples were evaluated via the UV-vis transmission (T) and reflection (R) measurements (Figs. S10(a)-S10(d) in the ESM), and the absorption of the prepared samples was calculated according to equation A=1-R-T. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Figs. S10(a)-S10(d) in the ESM, the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell NRs array shows a significantly enhanced absorption in the visible range. When depositing Au NPs, the light absorption is further improved. As the sputtering time increases, the surface plasmon resonance absorption of Au NPs increases significantly and the peak wavelength red-shifts continuously(Fig.2(a)).\nThe PL spectra of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig.\nA TSINGHUA Springer | wwww.editorialmanager.com/nare/default.asp\n5827\n2(b) and Fig. S11 in the ESM. The steady-state PL spectra shows two emission peaks, including an UV emission peak and a broad visible region emission peak when excited at 325 nm. The UV emission peak is attributed to the near-band (NB) emission of ZnO, while the wider visible emission peak is related to the recombination of photoexcited holes and electrons of oxygen vacancies and defect states on the surface of ZnO [37]. With the increase of the shell thickness of $TiO_{2},$ the PL emission peak intensity of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell NRs decreases continuously(Fig.S11(a) in the ESM). This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the charge separation effect of the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ heterojunction. It indicates that the TiO2 shell reduces the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs at the surface of ZnO. After coating Au NPs, the intensity of the emission peak is further weakened (Fig.2(b) and Fig. S11(b) in the ESM). The Au atom grown in oxygen vacancies could decrease the density of ionized oxygen vacancy and thus decrease the deep level emission. Furthermore, the electrons in the defect states of ZnO could be transferred to Au Fermi level and thus suppress the recombination. Note that in the visible light illumination, the plasmon-induced hot electrons of Au NPs can transfer back to the conduction band of ZnO because of their close energy level.\nThe PEC water splitting performances of ZnO NRs. ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ ,ZnO/Au and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au were evaluated through a series of electrochemical tests (Fig. 3). The ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell heterostructures exhibit the enhanced photocurrent density at the range from 0 to 1.4 V vs. RHE compared to ZnO NRs arrays under illumination. As the shell thickness of $TiO_{2}$ increases, the photocurrent density of the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell heterojunction shows a trend of increase first and then decrease (Fig. S12(a) in the ESM). Among them, the photocurrent density of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (15 nm) heterojunction is 1.83 mA/ $cm^{2}$ at 1.2 V vs. RHE, 1.31, 1.11 and 1.51 times higher than those of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(10$ nm)(1.40mA/ $cm^{2}$ at1.2Vvs.RHE),ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(20$ nm)(1.64 mA/ $cm^{2}$ at 1.2 V vs. RHE) and ZnO (1.21 mA/ $cm^{2}$ at 1.2 V vs. RHE), respectively. The enhanced PEC performance of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ samples is mainly attributed to the effective separation and transport of electron-hole pairs in the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ heterostructure under illumination. After Au NPs are deposited, the photocurrent density is further increased (Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S12(b) in the ESM). The photocurrent density in ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (15 nm)/Au(8 nm)(3.14 mA/ $cm^{2})$ is about 1.71 and 2.60 times those of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)(1.83 mA/ $cm^{2})$ and ZnO NRs(1.21mA/ $cm^{2})$ at 1.2 V vs. RHE, indicating that the Au NPs can promote the harvesting of solar light. Moreover, the photocurrent density of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8 nm) is superior to those previously reported photoanodes (Table S1 in the ESM). And the performance enhancement varies with the size of the Au NPs (Fig. 3(a)). The ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8 nm) with sputtering time(15 s) exhibits the highest photocurrent density compared to ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(6nm)withsputteringtimeof10sand ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(11 nm) with sputtering time of 20 s. It is noted that when the sputtering time increases to 20 s, excessive Au NPs are introduced in the system, which hinder the surface of the $TiO_{2}$ and reduce the availability of PEC reaction sites. Figure 3(b) and Figs. S12(c) and S12(d) in the ESM show the I-t curves of ZnO NRs,ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ core-shell NRs heterojunctions and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au samples at 1.2 V vs. RHE. An anodic current spike\n5828\nis observed due to the transient effects of power excitation, and then the photocurrent of the samples quickly returns to a more stable state, indicating that the photogenerated electrons are quickly transferred to the electrode/electrolyte interface, conductive to the enhanced PEC behavior.\nTo better understand the charge transfer kinetics of the electrode interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured for all the samples. From Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) and Figs. S12(e) and S12(f) in the ESM, the resistance of all the samples under light illumination is much lower than that in dark, and it decreases with the following order: ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au<ZnO@ $TiO_{2}<$ ZnO NR. The results are consistent with their PEC performances, showing that the photogenerated carriers can reduce the charge transfer impedance. When ZnO NR is coated with $TiO_{2},$ afaster electron transfer process occurs at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and Au modified ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ NRs array possesses the lowest resistance and thus allows for much faster electron transfer.To further evaluate the SPR enhancement effect of the Au NPs, the PEC performances of all the samples were measured under visible light $(\\ge 400$ nm) irradiation(Fig.S13 in the ESM). The ZnO@TiO2/Au electrode shows the significantly enhanced visible light PEC activity compared with the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ and ZnO electrode. Since ZnO has substantially no light absorption in the visible region, it produces a very low photocurrent. The ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)//Au(8 nm) still has the highest photocurrent density of 0.03 mA/ $cm^{2}$ at 1.2 V vs. RHE, 1.89 times higher than that of the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm). And fast photocurrent generation is observed under the visible light illumination. Note that the photocurrent density also decreases with increasing the sputtering time of Au NPs under visible light illumination. These results confirm that the photocurrent enhancement from Au NPs is mainly caused by the SPR effect in the visible light region and the hot electrons that are generated by plasmon damping under visible illumination can be injected into the $TiO_{2}$ and ZnO over the Schottky barrier, yielding a detectable photocurrent under visible light illumination. This can be seen from the following electromagnetic field simulations and transient absorption tests, and the results show the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8nm) sample achieves the maximum electromagnetic-field enhancement and the longest carrier lifetime.\nIn addition, the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of ZnO NRs,ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm),ZnO/Au(8nm) and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8m) photoanodes were measured to evaluate the performance of PEC (Fig.S14 in the ESM). In general, IPCE curves can well reproduce the shape of the absorption spectra of materials (Fig. 2(a)). In the UV region, all materials exhibit high IPCE properties. However, in the visible region, both ZnO NRs and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm) exhibit very low IPCE values, which is because the photon energy in the visible light region is lower than the band gap energy of ZnO and $TiO_{2}.$ After decorating Au NPs, the higher IPCE values can be observed for the ZnO/Au(8nm) and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8m),which indicates that the enhanced PEC activity of ZnO@TiO,(15nm)/Au(8m) is caused by the SPR effect of Au NPs.\n3.3 Hot electron transfer process\nTo analyze SPR-mediated hot electrons injection process in the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au system, the spatial distribution of the electric field at the interface between Au and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ or ZnO, ZnO and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ was simulated by COMSOL software (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S15(a) in the ESM). Figure 4(a) illustrates the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity on the models with different samples under the visible light (560 nm) illumination. The electric field intensity around the Au NPs is significantly\nenhanced, which can be seen as the hot spots in plasmonic metal nanostructures [33,35,38]. Among them, ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (15nm)/Au(8nm)samplehasthemaximumelectric-field intensity. Figures S15(b) and S15(c) in the ESM show the relationship between the electric field intensity (x-axis) and the wavelength, a strong and broad electric field intensity peak is observed in the visible region (500-700 nm), complying with SPRinduced electromagnetic field enhancement mechanism. The local electric field intensity around the plasmonic metal NPs is mainly dependent on the size of NPs, the distance between NPs and also surrounding medium thickness [33,35,38]. In the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ (15nm)/Au models,ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8nm)givesthe highest electric field enhancement, and the results show that there is suitable Au decoration for fixed $TiO_{2}$ thickness in the system. Furthermore, we also simulated the electric field intensity distribution of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au(8 nm) with different $TiO_{2}$ shell thicknesses (Fig. S15(a) in the ESM). Simulation results show that ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8nm) is the optimal structure for the field enhancement and hot electron generation. It is worth noting that hot spots appear at the interface of Au NPs and TiO2. Therefore, the hot electrons generated by the plasmon damping can be easily separated and transferred in such system (Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S16 in the ESM). The hot electrons are injected into the conduction band(CB) of TiO2 over the Schottky barrier, then transferred to the ZnO NRs and further transferred to the photocathode via an external circuit to react with water to form $H_{2},$ where in the holes left in the excited Au NPs can oxidize water to form $O_{2}[9,18,35].$To further understand the mechanisms of the hot electrons in the Au NPs component, we measured the samples by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy [32,33,39-41]. As shown in Fig. 5, the TA decay kinetics curves were fitted with biexponential function for researching the electron dynamics in the Au NPs with different environments via 420 nm pump wavelength. The TA signal decays rapidly due to the electron relaxations through electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering and then decays very slowly due tothe interaction of phonon-phonon and phonons with the surrounding medium [41-44]. Note that there is no signal observed in the TA for ZnO@ $TiO_{2}$ under 420 nm excitation because of the wide bandgap of $TiO_{2}$ and ZnO. The TA signal is thus attributed to the Au NPs. The ZnO/Au sample has\nA TSINGHUA Springer | wwww.editorialmanager.com/nare/default.asp\n5829\nfast decay with a time scale of 0.4 ps (electron-phonon) and 3.2 ps(phonon-phonon). When coating with $TiO_{2},$ the TA amplitude and decay time of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au are increased, indicating that the enhanced and prolonged hot electrons are generated due to the plasmon absorption enhancement and effective electron separation and transfer in the system. The decay time of the ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8nm) is the longest $(\\tau _{1}=2.4$ ps and $\\tau _{2}=$ 34.6 ps) with respect to ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(10$ nm)/Au(8 nm) for 1.2 ps and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(20$ nm)/Au(8 nm) for 2.3 ps. In addition, ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8nm)alsohastheexcellenthotelectron properties via 380 nm pump wavelength (Figs. S17 and 18 in the ESM). Compared with the decay kinetics of different samples, there is a suitable TiO2 shell thickness and Au decoration to achieve effective charge separation. The decay kinetics test is consistent with the PEC performance of the corresponding sample, indicating that such composites can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.\n4 Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we have synthesized the vertical arrays of ZnO@ $TiO_{2}/$ Au nanorods with various thicknesses of $TiO_{2}^{2}$ shell and different sized Au NPs onto an ITO substrate. Impressively, ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm)/Au(8 nm) shows the significantly enhanced PEC water splitting with respect to ZnO NRs arrays and ZnO@ $TiO_{2}(15$ nm). Further, it is superior to the state-of-the-art photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting (Table S1 in the ESM). The electric-field simulation and transient absorption spectroscopy show that the electric field near the Au NPs is significantly enhanced and the plasmon induced hot electrons can be effectively generated and further easily separated and transferred in the system. Altogether, this approach provides a viable strategy to achieve the outstanding PEC water splitting in the future practical applications.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21975060 and 21673053,X.L.W.and 52072354,H.Y.L.) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS(X.L.W.).\nElectronic Supplementary Material: Supplementary material(SEM,XRD,XPS,TA kinetics,etc.) is available in the online version of this article at https://doi.org/10.1007/s12274-0224203-z.\nReferences\n[1] Chen, S.

Here we report a novel metal/anioncoordination co-driven strategy for the formation of nanoscale supramolecular metallocycles with unique topology, large size, and desired chirality. The enantiomeric Janus-type metallocyclic strips are assembled based on the synergistic coordination of sulfate anions and CoII ions to a bifunctional achiral ligand combining the o-phenylene-(bis)urea anion-chelating and 8-hydroxyquinoline metal-coordinating sites. The inherent chirality arises from two types of helical chiralities (triply twisted Mobius ring and circular helicate), which is observed for the first time for metal-organic complex systems. Notably, spontaneous chiral resolution by conglomerate crystallization into a pair of enantiomers (P-or M- $Co_{9})$ is realized, which is attributed to the multiple weak intermolecular interactions facilitating the hierarchically helical superstructure.\n$C_{\\space\\text{to be one of the most attractive topics in supramolecular}}$ chemistry due to their structural resemblance to natural enzymes and potential applications in enantioselective events such as molecular recognition, separation, catalysis, and photophysics. $^{1-7}$ In recent decades, numerous discrete chiral metal-organic polygons ranging from nanoscopic dimers to a mesoscopic 47mer have been constructed. $^{5,7-14}$ They exhibit not only aesthetically pleasing structures but also specialized functional properties, with respect to the combined chirality and well-defined central cavities. In general, two main strategies have been used for the construction of homochiral metallo-supramolecular structures: employing chiral components such as organic ligands, counterions, or guests; and controlling the spatial organization of achiral components in one molecule followed by homochiral self-sorting assembly..12 Notably, compared to the many successful examples based on the former synthetic method, it is extremely rare to use spontaneous resolution to obtain chiral metallo-supramolecules, where only a few examples are known including triple helicates, $^{15}$ molecular $cages^{16-18}$ and metallocycles. $^{19,20}$ Therefore, the development of new methodologies to better control the spatial organization of achiral ligands is imperative.\nIn addition to the metal-coordination-based systems, in recent years, great efforts have been made in supramolecular architectures by \"anion-coordination-driven assembly\".21 It is found that in these \"aniono\" systems the lowering symmetry of anions can lead to \"symmetry breaking\" in supramolecular assembly.22 This may enhance the efficiency in controlling the spatial configuration of ligands compared to the spherical metal ions. Hence, by combining anion and metal coordination, it may provide better opportunities to achieve supramolecular structures with specific functionalities.\nIn order to construct chiral metallocycles, a bent C2symmetric multitopic ligand was designed here by functionalization of the (bis)urea anion-chelating unit with terminal 8hydroxyquinolinic metal-binding sites $(H_{2}L,$ Scheme 1). The\ncoordination of (bis)urea units to anions efficiently enhances the rigidity of long organic arms, while the bidentate 8hydroxyquinolinic groups can chelate octahedral metal ions to form a potentially chiral, helical geometry around a metal ion. $^{23,24}$ Herein, chiral Janus-type macrocyclic strips, formulated as [(TBA $)_{9}(HNEt_{3})_{3}] \\cdot [Co_{9}(L)_{6}($ and M- $Co_{9},$ TBA = tetrabutylammonium, Scheme 1), were successfully constructed through cooperative coordination of $Co^{II}$ and sulfate ions. Interestingly, spontaneous resolution of the racemates into a conglomerate of enantiomerically pure crystals (P- or M- $Co_{9})$ was achieved.\nACS Publications\n18221\nThe P- $Co_{9}$ crystal sample suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was prepared via the slow diffusion of methyl acetate into its dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. The complex crystallizes in the chiral space group $P6_{3}$ with four crystallographically independent but structurally similar[ $Co_{9}L_{6}]^{6+}$ molecules per unit cell (Figure S9); hence, only one of them will be discussed. Bond valence sum (BVS) $calculations^{25}$ confirm the +2 oxidation states of cobalt ions(Tables S3, S4). The crystal structure shows a double-layered triangular strip (Figure la) with $C_{3}$ symmetry, in which two different macrocyclic subunits (Figure 1b,c) are coupled by three $SO_{4}^{2-}$ and three $Co_{3}$ units (Figure S10a). Interestingly, the rotation of one arm of each $L^{2-}$ ligand by $109.1^{\\circ}$ along the urea group results in the folded conformation of $L^{2-},$ making the front macrocycle a triply twisted, helical M\"obius topology(Figure 1b). In contrast, a circular helical structure is observed for the back subunit where $L^{2-}$ naturally retains an in-plane bent conformation (Figure 1c). The folding of the ligand reduces the angles between the two arms of one ligand from $87.5^{\\circ}$ to $77.4^{\\circ}$ and increases the angles between the two arms of adjacent ligands from $136.9^{\\circ}$ to $161.3^{\\circ}$ (Figure S11). Although $L^{2-}$ ligands from two subunits adopt two different coordination modes $(\\mu _{3}- \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{2}$ and $\\mu _{5}- \\eta ^{3}: \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{2}$ for the front and back subunit, respectively, Figure S12), they are arranged alternately in a toroidal manner within each subunit. Importantly, the identical helical sense is considered as the origin of helical chirality for the Janus-type metallocyclic strip(Figure 1b,c).\nNotably, few examples of M\"obius metallosupramolecular structures have been reported to date. The trinuclear $Cu^{I}$ ring was isolated using a $C_{2}-$ symmetric bischelate-bridging ligand(bis(3-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole-1-ylmethyl)benzene)by Li et al.26 Lah et al. constructed a $C_{3}-$ symmetric $Mn_{15}L_{15}$ metallomacrocycle with a sextuple twisted M\"obius topology based on an asymmetric pentadentate ligand (N-phenylpropiolyl salicylhydrazide) $.^{27}$ Herein, it is the first time that a Mobius ring is observed to incorporate with other types of homochiral metallocyclic structures to form a unique metallocyclic strip, which benefits from the synergetic metal/anion-coordination co-driven assembly.\nFirst, each $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion in the corner of the triangular arrangement serves as template to preorganize two ligand strands, which makes a great contribution to the formation of the double-layered structure. Each $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion is ligated by four urea groups through eight strong hydrogen bonds $(N \\cdots O$ distances ranging from 2.79 to 3.13 A; $N-H \\cdots O$ angles from $127^{\\circ}$ to $167^{\\circ},$ Figure S13a and Table S5). According to previous reports, two bis(urea) arms usually embrace one $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion in a crossing manner. $^{28,29}$ In the current P- $Co_{9}$ complex, however, two bis(urea) units bind one $SO_{4}^{2-}$ in a parallel fashion to meet the requirement for terminal 8hydroxyquinolinic groups to coordinate with $Co_{3}$ units, which determines the cyclic skeleton. Within each $Co_{3}$ unit, three $Co^{II}$ ions are integrated by one $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion in a $\\mu _{3}- \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{1}: \\eta ^{1}$ fashion on one side, while it provides enough sites to connect multiple 8-hydroxyquinolinic units on the other side. Herein, one $\\mu _{3}-O _{\\text{quinolinic}}$ bridge from the $L^{2-}$ ligand is located at the opposite position to the $SO_{4}^{2-}$ bridge. Besides, Co1 and Co3(or Co2 and Co3) are bridged by one $\\mu _{2}-O _{\\text{quinolinic}}$ atom to create an obtuse triangular [ $Co_{3}O_{3}$ ( $SO_{4})]^{\\dag}$ central core(Figure S10b) with Co...Co...Co angles of $48.9^{\\circ},79.2^{\\circ}$ ,and $51.9^{\\circ},$ respectively. Co1 is encapsulated by two bidentate 8hydroxyquinolinic groups via N and O atoms; Co2 is coordinated by N and O atoms from one ligand, and the remaining sites are one monodentate $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion and one $H_{2}O$ molecule; Co3 is chelated by an $N _{\\text{imine}}$ atom and NO pocket of 8-hydroxyquinolinic groups. All $Co^{II}$ centers adopt distorted octahedral geometries (Figure S10c). This is reminiscent of a bowl-shaped $Co_{3}$ cluster by using a bidentate pyridine-alcohol ligand (6-methylpyridine-2-methanol), in which three CoII centers are linked in a triangular array by three ligands through three $\\mu _{2}-O$ atoms and one $\\mu _{3}-O$ atom from a DMSO molecule, and each ligand adopts the same coordination mode, $^{30}$ different from the current P- $Co_{9},$ with three different coordination modes for four ligands.\nThe outer size of P- $Co_{9}$ is about $3.0 \\times 3.0nm^{2}$ and the edge length of its inner cavity is approximately 2.0 nm (distance between two urea-bound $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anions). The superposition of two triangular macrocycles makes the thickness of P- $Co_{9}$ ca. 1.0nm(Figure 1d). Calculations using PLATON reveal that\n18222\nthe pore volume is 62 913 \\text{\\AA} $^{3}$ per unit cell (12 104 electrons), corresponding to approximately 59.5$\\%$ of the total volume, which is occupied by solvent molecules and $TBA^{+}$ counterions.\nIn general, circular helicates with inherently helical chirality tend to form racemic crystals (both enantiomers exist in the same single crystal) in the absence of an external chiral source instead of racemic conglomerates of a pair of enantiomers. $^{31,32}$ However, it is proven that intermolecular noncovalent interactions play a pivotal role for the spontaneous chiral resolution upon conglomerate crystallization. $^{18,33-36}A$ closer look at the molecular packing in Figure 2a reveals P- $Co_{9}$ molecules hierarchically assemble into a 3D hexagonal nanoporous framework (tertiary structure) from primary (P- $Co_{9}$ metallocyclic strip) and secondary (dimer of the metallocyclic strips) structures. (1) Two P- $Co_{9}$ macrocycles aggregate into a homochiral dimer through six strong hydrogen bonds (black circles in Figure 2b), in a \"circular-helicate to circular-helicate\" fashion with torsion angles in the range $46.5-49.2^{\\circ}.$ Here, each of three $HNEt_{3}^{+}$ cations in the lattice locates around the urea-coordinated $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion by electrostatic interactions and simultaneously binds to a metalcoordinated $SO_{4}^{2-}$ anion from an adjacent molecule through intermolecular $N-H \\cdots O$ hydrogen bonds. (2) The resulting dimers, serving as secondary building blocks, are packed into a 3D hexagonal nanoporous framework along the c-axis (Figures 2c and S16), in accord with the macroscopic hexagonal bipyramid shape of single crystals (Figure 2c, inset). As shown in Figure 2c, within the hexagonal repeating unit, the different packing modes of one middle (gray) and six peripheral (blue, green and yellow) molecules generate two types of nanoporous channels: a trigonal tube-like channel with a ca. 1.2 nm edge and a columnar channel with a ca. 0.9 nm diameter. Every three alternating peripheral dimers are coplanar and are staggered with the other three, being linked by the middle dimer through longitudinal CH $\\cdots \\pi$ interactions (2.7-3.2 A) and CH $\\cdots O _{\\text{carbonyl}}$ and CH $\\cdots N _{\\text{imine}}$ interactions (Figures S17, S18). As a result, a triple helix is formed along a $C_{6}$ screw axis parallel to the crystallographic c-axis (Figure 2d and inset). The middle dimers also rotate with an angle of $60^{\\circ}$ along this helical trajectory (Figure S19), resulting in a pore diameter of 0.9 nm. The supramolecular dimers stack with the alternating sequences of ABCDABCD (Figure 2a). Thus, the abundant intermolecular noncovalent interactions, which favor the helical superstructure, should be responsible for the spontaneous chiral resolution. It is known that cyclic molecules with helical chirality could lead to homochiral self-assembly by intermolecular stackings. $^{37}$ For example, the hexameric supramolecular macrocycles consisting of bent aromatic amphiphiles form homochiral helical tubules through one-dimensional stacking. $^{38}$\nIn order to ascertain the formation of conglomerates and the existence of the other enantiomer M- $Co_{9},$ two large single crystals with similar shapes and colors (marked as crystals A and B) were randomly selected to investigate the chirality by CD spectroscopy. Fortunately, CD spectra of individual A and B dissolved in DMF display Cotton effects of almost equal intensity and opposite signs at 267, 303, 350, and 410 nm, suggesting homochirality of a pair of enantiomers (Figure 3, top). Almost identical anisotropy factors $g= \\Delta A/A=$ $\\theta [$ mdeg $]/(32980 \\times A)^{39}$ were calculated to be $4.07 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $-4.03 \\times 10^{-4}$ at 267 nm, respectively (Figure S20). The CD bands are consistent with the absorptions at 279 and 385 nm in UV-vis spectra of P- and M- $Co_{9},$ which correspond to the $\\pi - \\pi *$ transition of the phenyl and 8-hydroxyquinolinic group, respectively. Besides, we further examined 10 more single-crystal samples via CD spectra (Figure S22), all of which show optical activity, and all 12 crystals have a 5:7 ratio for the two enantiomers. ESI-MS spectrometry (Figure 4) reveals two\n18223\ndominant anionic peaks, at m/z 1980.5 and 1424.8, for 3- and 4- species of P- and M- $Co_{g}.$ In addition, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and the cross-section analysis of the metallocyclic strips indicate that the thickness of the molecule is around 1.0 nm (Figure 1e,f), in agreement with the crystal structural analysis.\nMoreover, the kinetics of racemization in solution were studied by time-dependent CD measurements (Figure S23). The CD intensity change at 265 nm was fitted to the first-order kinetics, with a rate constant (k) of $1.725 \\times 10^{-2}min^{-1}$ and half-life $(t_{1/2})$ of 40 min.\nIn conclusion, an unprecedented nanoscale chiral Janus-type metallocyclic strip incorporating two types of helical chiralities was successfully assembled based on the synergistic coordination of sulfate anions and cobalt ions to an elaborately designed achiral ligand. P- $Co_{9}$ molecules hierarchically assemble into the 3D superstructure directed by multiple intermolecular noncovalent interactions, thus leading to spontaneous resolution into homochiral P- and M- $Co_{9}$ upon conglomerate crystallization. This assembly strategy opens up new avenues toward diverse sophisticated metal/anion coordination supramolecules with designable functionalities(chirality, magnetism, and luminescence).\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c05746.\nExperimental details and detailed crystallographic information (PDF)\nAccession Codes\nCCDC 2245230 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

We herein report a terpyridine-based metallo-cage T with a tetrahedral motif and utilized it as an efficient building block for the controlled hierarchical self-assembly of superstructures in response to different halide ions. Initially, the hierarchical superstructure of metallo-cage T adopted a hexagonal close-packed structure. By adding $Cl^{-}/Br^{-}$ or $I^{-},$ drastically different hierarchical superstructures with highly-tight hexagonal packing or graphite-like packing arrangements, respectively, have been achieved. These unusual halide-ion-triggered hierarchical structural changes resulted in quite distinct intermolecular channels, which provided new insights into the mechanism of three-dimensional supramolecular aggregation and crystal growth based on macromolecular construction. In addition, the chiral induction of the metallo-cage T can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP- or MMMM-type enantiomers.\nIntroduction\nTaking inspiration from the functional complexity of biomolecular systems, many synthetic supramolecular cages with well-defined shapes, sizes and functions have been prepared based on coordination bonds. $^{[1-18]}$ In positively charged metallo-cages, the anions are habitually considered as counterions and ignored due to their strong solvation in solution or high disorder in the solid state. $^{[19]}$ However, in biological systems, anions are essential for regulating a variety of important physiological and metabolic processes. $^{[20-23]}$ For example, cytochrome c oxidase, a key enzyme in respiration, is a heme-copper oxidase with a positively charged protein surface that can bind with a variety of anions to induce a redox-dependent structural change that affects the electron-transfer (ET) process. $^{[24]}$ Awareness of the important role of anions in the resulting metallo-cages has been raised from the reports of anionsdetermined self- $assembly^{[25-28]}$ including the encapsulation of $anions^{[29-30]}$ or anions-induced structural change. $^{31-35}$\nVery recently, hierarchical self-assembly by utilizing supramolecular cages as building blocks instead of small organic molecules has emerged, giving rise to superstructures with aesthetic perceptions and emergent functions. $^{[36-37]}$ It's well reported that anions can affect the inter- or intramolecular non-covalent interactions including hydrogen bonds, anion $- \\pi$ interactions and electrostatic contacts in a large part. However, anion-directed regulation of hierarchical superstructures from metallo-cages is still rare and presents great challenges. It's expected that anions can affect the hierarchical superstructures of metallo-cages by changing the inter- or intra-molecular interactions toward more sophisticated architectures and practical functions.\nHerein, we presented a rationally designed tpy-based(tpy=2,2':6,2''-terpyridine) metallo-cage T [ $Zn_{6}L_{4}]$ with tetrahedra geometry. Its hierarchical superstructure revealed that metallo-cage T alone adopts a hexagonal close packing arrangement in the solid state. More importantly, metallocage T can self-assemble in an adaptive hierarchical manner upon adding halide ions, leading to dramatically different superstructures. With the addition of $Br^{-}$ or $Cl^{-},$ metallocage T is stacked in a hexagonal packing mode, while graphite packing mode can be observed by adding $I^{-}$ (Scheme 1). As such, the hierarchical superstructure of metallo-cage T can be triggered by an external stimulus(halide ions) with intermolecular channels of adjustable size and shape. Although, the superstructure changes, described as phase transitions in response to various external stimuli\nhave been extensively investigated in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Scheme $1).^{[38-42]}$ This chemical signal (halide anions) responsive hierarchical superstructure change by using metallo-cage as a building block is a rare find. In addition, significant space constraints within metallo-cage T led to the rotation of three ortho-substituted tpy-arms around the central phenyl ring which adopts either P or M handedness configuration. Chiral induction on the metallocage T was realized when chiral anions (D- or L- sodium camphorsulfonate) (D- or L-SCS) are bounded.\nResults and Discussion\nSynthesis and characterization of metallo-cage T\nInitially, ligand L was synthesized through a 3-fold SuzukiMiyaura coupling reaction on 2,2''-dibromo-5'-(2-bromophenyl)-1,1':3',1''-terphenyl in a high yield (82$\\%$)(Scheme S1). Then a mixture of ligand L (1 equiv.) and Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (1.5 equiv.) was stirred in a mixture solvent ( $CH_{3}$ OH: $CHCl_{3}=4:3)$ at $60^{\\circ}C$ for 8 h to get a clean solution, which afforded precipitated by cooling to room temperature and following adding excess $NH_{4}PF_{6}.$ After thoroughly washing with DI water and drying in vacuo, the product was obtained quantitively as a pale-white solid(Figure 1a).\n$^{1}H$ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of metallo-cage T ( $CD_{3}$ OD,300 K) revealed only one set of tpy signals with the same diffusion coefficients $(D=2 \\times$ $10^{-10}\\space m^{2}\\cdot s^{-1})\\space($ Figure 1c), suggesting the formation of a single species with high symmetry. Characteristic doublets derived from 6,6'' protons of tpy dramatically shifted upfield (from 8.60 to 7.75 ppm, $\\Delta \\delta =0.85$ ppm) due to the electron shielding $effect^{[43]}$ caused by the pseudo-octahedral bis(terpyridine) complex (Figure 1b, Figures S2-S9). In addition, the composition of metallo-cage T was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)(Figure 1d, Figure S1) which displays a series of continuous peaks at m/z 2203.58,1616.44,1264.15,1029.29,861.54 attributed to charge states from 3+ to 7+. Travelling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS) plot displayed a narrow drift time distribution of each charge state for metallo-cage T which ruled out other isomers and conformers with different sizes (Figure $1e).^{[44-45]}$\nAnion-induced hierarchical self-assembly of metallo-cage T\nIn order to eliminate other impact factors (solvent, temperature, concentration), single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were all obtained by slow vapor diffusion of isopropyl ether into a concentrated N, N-dimethylformamide solution of metallo-cage T (10 mg/mL) as well as metallo-cage T-halide ions (in the presence of 10 equvi. tetrabutylammonium chloride, bromide, iodide) at $15 ^\\circ\\text{C} C$ (Figures $S28-S31).^{[46]}$ Metallo-cage T crystallized into the trigonal space group P31c, and metallo-cage T-halide ions( $Br^{-}, \\space Cl^{-}, \\space I^{-})$ all crystallized into triclinic space group $P \\bar{1}$ (Figures S32-S35, Table S1-S3). The solid-state X-ray structure of metallo-cage T exhibited a tetrahedra-shaped structure with $C_{3}-$ symmetry in which 4 ligands L have been mapped onto the vertices of the tetrahedra. In ligand L. three arms twist either clockwise (P) or anti-clockwise (M) due to the great steric hindrance of ortho substitution. Each ligand located on the vertices was shown to adopt a homotwisting direction (either P or M), and two of them form a pair of conformational enantiomers with opposite helical chirality: PPPP-T and MMMM-T in the unit cell. The zinc(II) centers are separated by distances of 16.3 \\text{\\AA} (Figure S38). Only one $PF_{6}^{-}$ was bound within the metallo-cage T cavity through $C-H \\cdots F$ hydrogen bondings (Figure 2a,\nFigures S36-37). Two metallo-cage Ts (primary structures) aggregate into a supramolecular dimer within a unit cell by adopting a ``head-to-head'' mode (Figure 2b, Figure S38). $PF_{6}^{-}$ didn't connect the two metallo-cage Ts and just served as counterions. $\\pi ... \\pi$ interactions between two metallo-cage Ts are absent either. But the CH $\\cdots \\pi$ interactions with a distance of $3.1 \\space \\dot{\\Lambda}$ between the two vertices of metallo-cage T have been observed, which held the two cages together(Figure 2c). These dimers (secondary structures) are packed to form a staggered helical column (tertiary structure, Figure 2d, Figure S39), further self-organize into a quaternary supramolecular structure through a hexagonal close packing arrangement with a triangular intermolecular channel in a 10.4 A diameter (Figure 2e, Figures S40-S43). The closest form of packing undoubtedly is an energetically favorable crystallization process due to the lack of intermolecular interactions.\nUpon adding $Br^{-}$ or $Cl^{-}$ (denoted as T--Br or T--Cl), no encapsulation of halide ions or structural change of metallocage T was found owing to its rigid structure and large cavity. Instead, it crystallized into another hierarchical superstructure of the triclinic crystalline phase. First, the addition of $Br^{-}$ or $Cl^{-}$ leads to more encapsulation of $PF_{6}^{-}$ (A total of five, four $PF_{6}^{-}$ located at the corners and one located in the center) in the cavity of metallo-cage T(Figure 3a, Figure S44-45). Second, $PF_{6}^{-}$ was found to connect the two metallo-cage Ts within a unit cell leading to an ``edge-to-plane'' modal dimer (Figure 3b, Figure S46). Compared to the unit cell of metallo-cage T, two kinds of C-H...F hydrogen bondings ranging from 2.5-2.8 \\text{\\AA} bring the two cages closer to each other (Figure 3c). Along the crystallographic b axis, two metallo-cages T are aligned in parallel with a center-to-center distance of 14.1 \\text{\\AA} within one unit cell (Figure S46). Thus, T-Br or T-Cl stacked in a tighter hexagonal packing mode with negligible intermolecular channels (Figures 3d-3f, Figures S47-S51, S71).\nFurther, the addition of $I^{-}$ (denoted as T-I) resulted in another hierarchically structural form. In terms of primary structure, five $PF_{6}^{-}$ are bound within the metallo-cage T cavity as well (Figure 4a, Figure S52). As to a unit cell, besides C-H...F hydrogen bonds ranging from 1.8-2.9 \\text{\\AA}. powerful anion $- \\pi$ interactions existed in the central pyridine-\nring and benzene-ring of the two cages' dimer ranging from 2.2-2.5 \\text{\\AA}. $^{[47-49]}\\space \\pi \\cdots \\pi$ interactions (d[centroid...centroid]=3.4 A) between two lateral pyridine-ring can also be observed (Figure $4c).^{[50-51]}$ The two cages within the unit cell are stacked in as ``edge-to-edge'' manner with a center-tocenter distance of 8.1 A along the crystallographic b axis\n(Figure 4b, Figure S53), and further self-organized into a hierarchical superstructure in a graphite-like pattern, which resulted in a 3D porous framework that possesses large, infinite, and hexagonal channels with a diameter of $\\approx 27.4$ \\text{\\AA}(Figures 4d-4f). This energetically unfavorable porous hierarchical superstructure is stabilized by the multiple noncovalent interactions (Figures S54-S59).\nAs mentioned above, the addition of halide ions dramatically alters the hierarchical superstructure of metallo-cage T: from hexagonal close packing (T) to highly-tight hexagonal packing (T-Br, T--Cl) or graphite-like packing(T-I). Correspondingly, solution-state data were consistent with the solid-state structure. We carried out $the^{1}H$ NMR and UV/Vis experimens by adding halide ions $(F^{-}, \\space Cl^{-},$ , $I^{-},$ as TBA salts, halide ions: T=10:1) individually into the solution of metallo-cage T in $CD_{3}$ OD. Compared to metallo-cage T, the signals of metallo-cage T--Cl, T-Br, T-I revealed a downfield shifts (Figures S24-25). Decrease of UV absorptions can be detected as well (Figuer S60). In addition, titration experiments have been carried out for other anions of different sizes, mainly $OTf^{-}, NTf_{2}^{-},$ $BF_{4}^{-}$ , $CH_{3}COO^{-}$ , $HPO_{4}^{2-}.$ With the addition of these anions. no shifts of the peaks for the metallo-cage T were observed(Figures S26-S27), further demonstrating that only the addition of the halide ions had an effect on the equilibrium of metallo-cage T and $PF_{6}^{-}.$ Therefore, it probably attributed to halide ions' destruction on the equilibrium between metallo-cage T and $PF_{6}^{-},$ which thoroughly changed the intermolecular interactions. The adaptive hierarchically structural change is probably caused by the difference in electric charge density of halide ions, $^{[52]}$ which leads to different interactions between metallo-cage T and $PF_{6}^{-}.$\nChiral induction\nEstabilished by the X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis, a pair of enantiomers (PPPP- or MMMM- type metallocage) can be observed in metallo-cage T or metallo-cage Thalide ions. The significant space constraints within ligand L led to the rotation of three ortho-substituted tpy-arms around the central phenyl ring, resulting in symmetry $breaking^{[53]}$ of achiral molecules at the supramolecular level. However, it afforded a racemic mixture: PPPP-T and MMMM-T due to their approximately equal energy. Considering chiral cages' wide applications including chiral sensing, $^{[54-55]}$ enantioselective separation, $^{[56-58]}$ asymmetric catalysis, $^{[59-61]}$ and circularly polarized luminescence materials, $^{[62-64]}$ it's highly intriguing and desirable to obtain chiral cages from anions' chiral induction. In view of its electron-deficient and hydrophobic cavity, metallo-cage T is easy to bind with negatively charged anions. Once complexing with chiral anions, the original two enantiomers will change into two a non-equimolar mixture of the diastereomers. If there is a significant energy difference between the two diastereomers, the equilibrium will completely shift to one of the two forms. Therefore, it's envisioned that the binding of chiral anions to metallo-cage T can induce the generation of enantiopure assemblies (Figure 5a).\nChiral 10-sodium camphor sulfonate (D-SCS, L-SCS)(Figures S10-11) was chosen as the chiral anions and directly added to the solution of metallo-cage T. The obvious upfield shift at room temperature in $the^{1}H$ NMR spectrum strongly indicated the binding behavior (Figure 5b, Figure S12). For example, two methyl-proton peaks attributed to $H^{c}, \\space H^{g}$ for free D-SCS appeared as singlets at 1.11 ppm and 0.85 ppm, whereas the same singlets for host-guest complex D-SCS $\\subset -$ MMMM-T shifted upfield to 1.03 ppm and 0.74 ppm,\nrespectively. Also, a similar observation was noticed that other proton resonances derived from $H^{a}, \\space H^{b}, \\space H^{d}, \\space H^{e}, \\space H^{t}$ displayed distinct upfield shifts. 2D DOSY NMR spectrum showed that the proton signals assigned to the host $(\\log D=$ -9.7) and anion $(\\log D=-9.2)$ were located at two different bands (Figures S13-S19), indicating the fast exchange on the NMR time scale (Figures $S20-21).^{[65-67]}$ In addition, single crystal diffraction data revealed a concave tetrahedra motif for metallo-cage T (Figures S22-23, S67), which led to a great decrease in internal cavity volume. The volume of the inner cavity is too small, and can only encapsulate small anions, such as $PF_{6}^{-}(75 \\space A^{3}),$ not to accommodate a large guest (camphor sulfonate). But, the concave triangular faces of metallo-cage T can serve as peripheral guest binding pockets. The calculation of peripheral cavity volume for metallo-cage T by VOIDOO (Figure S68) has been conducted which revealed a peripheral cavity of $294 \\space A^{3}$ to encapsulate a camphor sulfonate following the size suitability (Figure $S69-S70).^{[68]}$ Moreover, the generation of hostguest complex together with 1:1 stoichiometries was confirmed by UV-titration by Job Plot method (Figures S61S64). The binding constants of metallo-cage T and D-SCS were obtained by means of Scatchard's diagram up to 5.43 $(\\pm 0.168)\\times 10^{4}\\space M^{-1},$ which was fitted using a 1:1 binding isotherm (Figures S65-S66, Table S4).\nFurther, the chiral anion-induced chirality in solution was examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Initially, there is no CD signal for the racemic metallo-cage T. Following the addition of chiral anions, solutions of hostguest complexes show strong CD signals at the wavelength range 330-380 nm which agrees well with UV absorption(Figure 6a). Notably, the CD spectra of L-SCS $\\subset$ PPPP-T features the positive Cotton effect, while its enantiomer DSCS $\\subset$ MMMM-T shows mirror images with the negative Cotton effect. The generated CD signals resulted from supramolecular chirality because chiral anions (D-, L-SCS) exhibited opposite CD signals at the wavelength range 280320nm (Figure 6b). To understand the chiral anions-induced\nchiral induction of racemic tetrahedra, the theoretical calculation was conducted by using density functional theory(DFT) (Figure 6c, the detailed calculation method is placed in the Experiment section in Supporting Information). The computations indicated that the host-guest complexes were more stable than hosts supported by the negative value of binding energy. Moreover, D-SCS $\\subset$ MMMM-T is 2.64 kcal/mol more stable than D-SCS $\\subset$ PPPP-T, which is consistent with the fact that D-SCS induced a negative CD signal. On the contrary, L-SCS $\\subset$ PPPP-T is 4.96 kcal/mol more stable than L-SCS $\\subset$ MMMM-T, correspondingly giving a positive CD signal. Upon accommodation of a chiral anion, one of the two cage enantiomers becomes more thermodynamic favored than the other due to the chiral match/mismatch effect, $^{[69-70]}$ then producing CD signals. Therefore, enantiopure metallo-cage T can be facilely achieved by peripheral guests' chiral induction.\nConclusion\nWe have presented a metallo-cage T with tetrahedra motif based on $\\langle$ tpy- $Zn^{2+}-$ tpy $\\rangle$ connectivities. This metallo-cage T can be employed as an efficient building block for hierarchical superstructures, featuring remarkable halide ions-induced adaptive packing patterns of crystalline structures. Three different hierarchical superstructures were achieved with the addition of different halide ions which alerted the intermolecular interactions between metallocage T and $PF_{6}^{-}.$ Such controllable hierarchically structural change is accompanied by the altering of intramolecular channels which provides a novel insight into 3D supramolecular aggregation and crystal growth mechanisms based on large molecular tectonics.\nIn addition, stereochemically selective self-assembly of enantiopure metallo-cage T has been realized by facilely adding chiral anions. Our results provide a new approach for the synthesis of chiral metallo-organic architectures, further enabling the exploration of practical functions including circularly polarized luminescence materials, chirality separation, asymmetric catalysis, and so on.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22101061 to Z.Z., 21971257 to P.W., 21971048 to T.-Z.X.), Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research of City and University (Institute) Joint Funding Project (SL2022 A03 J01050 to P.W., SL2022 A03 J00929 to Z.Z., 202201022174 to T.-Z.X.), the Guangdong Provincial Pearl River Talents Program(2019QN01 C243 to T.-Z.X.), the Science and Technology Projects in Guangzhou (202201010664 to T.W.), the Youth Project of Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(2021 A1515110696 to Q.L.), the Basic and Applied Basic Research Project of Guangzhou (202002030430 to Q.L.), the Characteristic Innovation Project of Guangdong Universities (2022KTSCX094 to Q.L.) and the Funding Program of Postgraduate Creative Ability Training in Guangzhou University (2020GDJC-M17 to Y.L.).
