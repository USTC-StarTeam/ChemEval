Newman*\n3 Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular 4 Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1N 6N5.\n5 Abstract\n6 The coupling of tertiary alcohols with boronic esters is described, providing a direct access to 7 quaternary carbon scaffolds without needing to proceed by a highly activated intermediate such as 8 an alkyl halide. A dual catalyst system is employed with both Ni(0) and Bi(III) components playing 9 a critical role along with a mild chlorosilane reactant that enhances the yield by alcohol silylation. 10 This method was found to tolerate diverse functional groups including chloro, nitro, olefin, ketone, 11 ester and phenol moieties, while also being applicable to the derivatization of heterocyclic 12 scaffolds. Mechanistic studies suggest the combination of Lewis acid catalyst and organosilane promote heterolytic cleavage of the substrate C--O bond by an $S_{N}1-$ like reaction pathway, providing a powerful strategy for derivatizing readily available alcohols.\n13 14\nCross-coupling reactions are among the most utilized reactions in the contemporary 16 pharmaceutical industry, with Suzuki-Miyaura coupling standing out primarily due to the ease of 17 handling, commercial availability, and mildness of organoboron reactants. $^{1, \\space 2}$ With aryl halides and 18 pseudohalides as the most common and reliable electrophilic coupling partners, $^{3, \\space 4}$ there is demand 19 for better methods to engage C( $sp^{3})-$ hybridized $electrophiles^{5, \\space 6}$ and for the use of surrogates for 20 halides, such as C--O bonds. $^{7, \\space 8}$\n15\nIn recent years, several strategies have emerged to enable alcohols to participate in crosscoupling chemistry. For example, unprotected alcohols bearing a nearby $\\pi -$ electron system such 23 as phenols, $^{9, \\space 10}$ benzyl $alcohols^{11, \\space 12}$ and allylic $alcohols^{13}$ have been shown to be sufficiently 24 activated to undergo catalytic arylation. Towards reacting aliphatic alcohols, stoichiometric 25 activation of the C( $sp^{3})--O$ bond to provide a reactive intermediate that may either be isolated or 26 formed in situ has emerged as a powerful strategy. For instance, $oxalates^{14}, thiocarbamates^{15},$ and 27 NHC-alcohol $adducts^{16}$ have all been demonstrated to participate in deoxygenative arylation 28 chemistry, $^{17-19}$ while electrochemical activation, $^{20}$ oxazolium salts, $^{21}$ or triphenylphosphonium 29 $anhydride^{22}$ have been demonstrated to enable alcohol coupling by in situ halogenation and subsequent arylation.\n21 22 30 31 32\n33\nLewis acid catalysis is another powerful strategy to facilitate activation and derivatization of alcohols via an $S_{N}1-$ type pathways. $^{23}$ While this approach is primarily documented with 35 traditional nucleophiles, we speculated that a similar approach may enable direct alcohol arylation 36 by trapping with a transition metal catalyst and organoboron reagent, providing a more direct 37 pathway to alcohol arylation than recently reported stoichiometric activation methods. $^{24-26}$ 38 Disclosed herein are our efforts towards this goal, culminating in a direct and general method for 39 arylating cyclic tertiary alcohols to form quaternary carbon centers.\n34\nWith the working hypothesis that a dual transition metal/Lewis acid co-catalyst system to 41 enable direct alcohol arylation (Scheme 1B), a high throughput screening campaign .was carried 42 out to investigate different metals, ligands, Lewis acids, and organometallic nucleophiles. $^{27}$ Ahit 43 was identified when using a combination of Ni(0), an atypical ligand bearing two NHC units, $^{28}$ 44 Bi(OTf) $_{3}$ as a mild Lewis acid, $^{29}$ and PhBpin, which enabled the functionalization of piperidinol 45 1 to provide arylated product 2 in 16$\\%$ yield (Table 1, entry 1). Lewis acid-catalyzed activation of 46 alcohols has often been facilitated by the addition of organosilane reagents. $^{30-32}$ In our reaction, 47 introducing dimethyldichlorosilane ( $Me_{2}SiCl_{2})$ led to an increased yield of 34$\\%$ (entry $2).^{33}$ Pre48 mixing the alcohol with the organosilane to first form the intermediate silyl ether led to a further 49 increase in the yield to 73$\\%$ (entry 3). The nature of the NHC ligand proved important, with more 50 common ligands like IPr and ICy being ineffective (entries 4, 5). Running the reaction in the 51 absence of either the Ni or Bi(OTf)3 provided no evidence of arylation, confirming the importance 52 of the dual catalytic conditions.\n40\nTo explore the scope of this deoxygenative arylation, a range of N-methyl-piperidinyl 54 scaffolds were first examined. Variously sized substitutions adjacent to the alcohol were tolerated 55 with larger groups generally providing higher yields (2-5). A vinyl group (6) and an allyl group(7) were also tolerated with no evidence of isomerization or rearrangement. Heterocyclic 57 substituents including pyridine (8) and furan (9) were tolerated, albeit in low yields. No product 58 was obtained upon placing an electron-withdrawing group adjacent to the reactive center (10) or 59 upon subjecting a secondary alcohol (11) to this methodology.\n53 56\nAn assortment of cyclic hydrocarbon rings ranging in size from 4-10 carbons were next 61 arylated (12-17), as was 1-adamantanol (18), a tetrahydropyran (19) and a cyclohexenol (20). The 62 arylation of various bioactive scaffolds was also evaluated, enabling the preparation of derivatives\n60\n63 of desmethylvenlafaxine (21), loperamide (22) and cedrol (23). While we found that tertiary cyclic 64 alcohols were privileged substrates in this reaction, $^{34}$ primary (24,25) and secondary (26) alcohols 65 could also be arylated provided they were located adjacent to a $\\pi -$ system.\n66 67\nNi(cod $)_{2}(10$ mol$\\%$),NHC(10mol$\\%$),\nPhBpin (1.5 equiv), Bi(OTf $)_{3}(15$ mol$\\%$),\n$\\overline{K_{3}PO_{4}(2.0 \\space equiv),KO^{t}Bu(20mol $\\%$)}$\nMe\nPhMe, $70 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,10h$\n68\n2\n69 70 71 72 73 General reaction conditions: 0.20 mmol starting material, 0.02 mmol Ni(cod) $_{2}, \\space 0.02$ mmol NHC ligand, 0.30 mmol PhBpin, 0.03 mmol Bi(OTf) $_{3}, \\space 0.20$ mmol $Me_{2}SiCl_{2}, \\space 0.40$ mmol $K_{3}PO_{4}, \\space 0.04$ mmol $KO^{t}$ Bu in 0.8 mL PhMe. $^{a}$ yields acquired by GC-FID using 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as internal standard. $^{b}$ starting material (0.20 mmol) stirred with $Me_{2}SiCl_{2}\\space(0.20$ mmol) and $K_{3}PO_{4}\\space(0.40$ mmol) in 0.4 mL PhMe at rt for 30 minutes before adding other reagents.\nFunctional group compatibility was further investigated by varying the structure of the 75 boronate ester coupling partner (27-43). Notable examples demonstrate tolerance of unprotected 76 O-H groups (29, 30, 37), halogens (32, 35, 40), and heterocycles (36-43). A gram-scale reaction 77 was performed at reduced catalyst loading to reveal indole 38 in yields reflective of the optimized 78 conditions. Lastly, we investigated if the coupling of diols could occur chemoselectively. Using 3 79 equiv of chlorosilane, cyclic tertiary alcohols bearing a primary (44), secondary (46), or tertiary acyclic (48) alcohol provided good yields of the monoarylated product after work-up with TBAF. 74 80 81\nArmed with an adequate knowledge of the reaction scope and functional group tolerance, 82 we sought to gain mechanistic insight. The silane additive was confirmed to silylate the alcohol 83 under the reaction conditions and various silyl ethers were shown to undergo arylation without the 84 need for additional chlorosilane, confirming that the silyl ether is a viable reactive intermediate\n85\n86 87 88 89 90\n(see Supporting Information Table S12). The corresponding alkyl chloride and alkyl triflate were 92 also prepared and found to be ineffective starting materials, suggesting that the in situ halogenation 93 mechanism is not operative. $^{20-22}$\n91\n94\nDuring the reaction discovery and screening efforts, a mechanism in which a reactive carbocation intermediate was generated and intercepted was envisioned. An alternative pathway 96 involves dehydration to the olefin and subsequent metal-catalyzed hydroarylation. $^{35, \\space 36}$ Indeed, 97 olefins such as compound 50 were commonly observed in the crude reaction mixture. However, subjecting 50 directly to the standard reaction conditions did not afford arylated product, indicating it is a side-product rather than a reactive intermediate. Another alternative pathway may involve formation of a carbon-centered radical, as commonly proposed in the coupling of alkyl halides. $^{37,}$ $^{38}$ However, this reaction was found to be unaffected by the presence of TEMPO or other radical scavenging reagents (Scheme 3A). Further, cyclopropane $(51)\\space ^{39}$ and 5-hexenyl $(54)^{40}$ bearing substrates were arylated to form products 52 and 55 without evidence of rearrangement products 53 and 56, which would be expected if a carbon-centered radical was formed.\n95 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105\nTowards exploring the plausibility of a carbocation intermediate, a Hammett study was carried out on a series of silylated alcohols with varying electronic properties (Figure $3B).^{41}$ Silyl ethers 57a-e were found to be smoothly arylated under the reaction conditions to afford piperidines 58a-e with the lowest yields resulting from the more electron-deficient alcohols. The same trend was observed when studying the reaction kinetics-more electron-deficient alcohols led to slower 110 rates of reaction. A linear relationship was observed upon plotting the normalized rate constants 111 against the $\\sigma _{p}^{+}$ parameter, with a $\\rho$ value of -1.19 suggesting a substantial buildup of positive charge in the transition state in this particular benzylic example. $^{42}$\n106 107 108 109 112 113\nCarbocations are known to be susceptible to rearrangements such as 1,2-alkyl and 1,2114 hydride shifts. Accordingly, substrate 59, and 61H were prepared, which we speculated would 115 rearrange if a carbocation is a reaction intermediate Scheme 3C). Rearranged scaffolds 60 and $62_{H}$ 116 were observed as the only identifiable arylation products. Furthermore, the deuterated analog $61_{D}$ 117 was also found to rearrange to 62D, albeit in just 21$\\%$ yield, suggesting a more sluggish migration 118 of deuterium.\n119\nTo probe if the reaction proceeds by retention, inversion, or loss of stereochemical 120 information, diastereomerically pure alcohol 63 was subjected to the general reaction conditions(Scheme 3D). Diastereomeric products $64_{A}$ and $64_{B}$ were obtained in a 1:1 ratio. The same substrate was subject to Friedel-Crafts conditions (refluxing sulfuric acid in benzene) $,^{43}$ and was 123 found to provide the same ratio of products, suggesting a similar reactive intermediate is likely.\n121 122 124\n125 126 127 128 129\nLastly, kinetic analysis was performed on alcohols 57b and 65 according to the variable time--normalization analysis method. $^{44}$ For tertiary aliphatic alcohol 65, results suggest positive, apparent first order involvement of the substrate, Ni-NHC catalyst and Lewis-acid catalyst at the transition state of this reaction (Scheme 3E). In contrast, tertiary benzylic silyl ether 57b exhibited 130 first-order dependence on only the substrate and Bi(OTf) $_{3}.$ While all data thus far was supportive 131 of the presence of an $S_{N}1-$ type pathway, we were surprised at the suggested rate dependence of Ni 132 in the arylation of 65. We thus conducted an Eyring $analysis^{45}$ on both substrates, revealing a positive entropy of activation for 57b and a negative entropy of activation in 65, further corroborating the different rate equations observed in the kinetic analysis. Collectively, this data suggests that the benzylic alcohol 57b may be arylated via a carbocation in an $S_{N}1-$ like process 136 with Lewis acid catalysis alone, while the Ni-catalyst may be involved in the arylation of the aliphatic alcohol $65. \\space ^{46-48}$ Further efforts are underway to further understand the nature of the key C--O bond cleavage step, the origin for high selectivity towards tertiary cyclic alcohols, and how the reactive carbocation-like intermediate may react with the Ni catalyst and organoboronate ester to form new C--C bonds.\n133 134 135 137 138 139 140\n141\nIn summary, we have described a straightforward method to directly arylate unactivated 142 tertiary alcohols with organoboron reagents. A Ni(0) catalyst is used in concert with a mild Lewis 143 acid, enabling coupling a broad scope of arenes including those bearing heterocyclic rings, 144 carbonyl groups, halides, and more. Chemoselectivity is demonstrated for polyols, with arylation occurring selectively on tertiary cyclic alcohols. The observation of rearranged products, stereochemical erosion, a strong Hammett relationship, and first order rate dependance on 147 substrate and Lewis acid are consistent with an $S_{N}1-$ like alcohol activation process, which to our 148 knowledge is a largely undeveloped strategy for facilitating cross-coupling reactions with bulky aliphatic coupling partners.\n145 146 149\n150 References\n151 152 153\n1.

In this development, methanol serves as a sustainable C1 source. A variety of aromatic and aliphatic substituted alcohols and phosphines could undergo the dehydrogenative cross-coupling process efficiently and deliver the corresponding $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylated alcohol products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds in a sequential manner including catalytic dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, Michael addition, and catalytic hydrogenation.\n$\\bigcirc$ wing to the broad application of phosphine-containing compounds in biologically active molecules (such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, etc.) $^{1}$ and organic synthesis (e.g., as building blocks, organocatalysts, ligand in transition-metal catalysis, etc.), the development of new synthetic methodologies, preferably in an atom- and stepeconomical and sustainable manner, continues to be highly demanded and scientifically interesting.\nOn the other hand, alcohols are benign, sustainable chemicals that are readily available from well-developed industrial processes and numerous biomass resources. $^{3}$ During the past few decades, transition metal-catalyzed borrowing hydrogen (BH) reactions have emerged as powerful tools in synthesizing value-added molecules from alcohols. $^{4}$ Importantly, such processes do not require tedious isolation of the in situ formed intermediates, which therefore provides better atom- and step-economy. Using this approach, a variety of valuable compounds have been successfully synthesized, where in these cases, $H_{2}O$ and/or $H_{2}$ are usually generated as  green  byproducts. Despite the advances made in this area, the preparation of phosphine-containing compounds using the BH process has scarcely been explored. Based on our continuous research $interest^{\\circ}$ in pincer manganese-catalyzed transformation7 of alcohols to make C-C and C-N bonds, we are also attracted to the construction of C-P bonds with manganese $catalysis^{8}$ through the BH strategy.\nMethanol is one of the most important alcohols and also presents as an attractive C1 feedstock in organic synthesis.9 Recently, our group established a manganese-catalyzed threecomponent coupling with secondary alcohols, primary alcohols, and methanol for the synthesis of $\\beta , \\beta -$ methylated/alkylated secondary alcohols. $^{6a}$ It should be noted that this kind of $\\beta -$ methylation with methanol was previously developed using homogeneous precious transition metals (by Beller, $^{10}$ Leitner, $^{11}$ Tu, $^{12}$ Srimani, $^{13}$ and $Kundu^{14})$ and 3d metal catalysts (by Liu, $^{15}$ Morrill, $^{16}$ Kempe,17 and $Leitner^{18})($ Figure 1a). The process of the methylation mentioned above generally involves dehydrogenation of alcohols to generate carbonyl\nACS Publications\n25545\ncompounds, followed by an Aldol reaction to afford $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo double hydrogenation to provide the products.\nDue to the significance of C-C and C-P bond formation, we speculated whether the double hydrogenation process of unsaturated carbonyl intermediates could be interrupted by phosphines, $^{19}$ where first it undergoes an addition reaction with phosphine, then hydrogenation to result in $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylated alcohol products. To the best of our knowledge, such $\\gamma -$ hydroxy phosphines are typically prepared via a sequential lithiation-nucleophilic substitution process(Figure 1b).20 Another approach starting from alcohol involves oxidation, condensation with formaldehyde, Michael addition with phosphine, and reduction (Figure 1b). These methods suffer from several drawbacks, such as using moisture-sensitive organometallic agents, oxidants, and reductants, generating a stoichiometric amount of halide waste, and requiring isolation of the prepared intermediates.\nTo address the aforementioned limitations of reported synthetic methods, herein, we disclose a straightforward $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylation of alcohols using methanol as a sustainable C1 source in the presence of a manganese catalyst(Figure 1c). The transformation proceeds with an earthabundant metal $catalyst^{21}$ in a single step, without the requirement of stoichiometric amounts of oxidants or reductants, and does not require isolation of any intermediates. Additionally, water and $H_{2}$ are the main byproducts of this process and are both \"green\". It should be noted that such combinatorial fashion involving the transformation of alcohol via BH strategy has been successfully applied for synthesizing functionalized products.22\nWe started our investigation by using 2-phenylethanol (1a), diphenylphosphine (2a), and methanol as model substrates. When the reaction was carried out with 1a (0.5mmol),2a(0.6 mmol), and methanol (3.0 mmol) with PNP-Mn $complex^{23}$ (1.0mol$\\%$),KOtBu(20mol$\\%$)in1,4-dioxane,the corresponding $\\gamma -$ hydroxy phosphines 3 was obtained in 54$\\%$NMR yield (Table 1, entry 1). To our delight, the yield of 3 could be improved to 78$\\%$ when dimethoxyethane (DME) was used as the solvent. Other solvents were screened, including octane, toluene, MeOH, bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (diglyme), and tAmOH, which all afforded lower yields or only a trace amount of products (entries 2-7). By increasing the loading amount of KOtBu to 30 and 40 mol $\\%$, yields of 3 could be enhanced up to excellent yields of 86$\\%$ and 96$\\%$, respectively. However, a diminished yield was observed by further increasing the base loading amount (entry 10). A comparable yield (90$\\%$) could be obtained by replacing KOtBu with KOMe, but lower yields were furnished with NaOtBu, LiOtBu, and NaOMe (entries 11-14). When the phosphinomethylation reaction was conducted under a lower reaction temperature $(120 ^\\circ\\text{C})$ ,the desired product could be delivered in a comparable high isolated yield of 87$\\%$ (entry 15). Control experiments without the manganese catalyst and base did not afford the desired product, which indicated the essential role of the catalyst and base (entries 16-17). Other tested PNP-Mn catalysts afforded lower yields or only trace amount of the desired product.24\nWith the optimized conditions in hand, we investigated the scope of alcohols in the manganese-catalyzed three-component $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylation reaction system (Scheme 1). First, the reaction could be easily scaled as reflected by the transformation of 1a carried out on a 5.0 mmol, which\nOH\nMn(1.0mol$\\%$)\nOH\n+MeOH +HPPh\nBase, Solvent\nPh\n$140 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,15h$\nPh\n$PPh_{2}$\n1a\n2a\n3\n$^{a}$ Condition:1a(0.5mmol),2a(0.6mmol),methanol(3.0mmol),[Mn](1.0mol$\\%$),base,and solvent(1.0mL),stirredat $140 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 15 h.

Moreover, various $\\beta -H-$ containing alcohols were demonstrated to be suitable substrates to furnish the desired products efficiently. For example, a range of 2-phenylethanol with a variety of substituents on the benzene ring could each be subjected to the reaction conditions and afforded the desired corresponding product smoothly. For instance, these substrates with carbon moieties, including methyl (4,15,and 20) and tert-butyl (5), delivered the corresponding products in excellent yields (82$\\%$-91$\\%$). Next, we evaluated the efficiency of the reaction with substrates containing heteroatoms. Delightedly, the reactions with alkyloxides (6-8), sulfide(9), and amino (10) tethered 2-phenylethanols were all viable in high efficiency. Interestingly, labile halogen groups, such as fluoro(11,17,22,and23),chloro(12and18),andbromo(13 and 19), were all tolerated in the reaction system to deliver the phosphinomethylated alcohols in 60-91$\\%$ yields. However, the substrate with a highly electron-deficient trifluoromethyl group afforded the product in a comparatively lower yet still synthetically useful yield (14, 50$\\%$). The 2-phenylethanols with ortho-substituents led to slightly lower yields, which could probably be due to steric hindrance. When $\\pi -$ extended aromatic rings of 2-naphthaleneethanol and 1naphthaleneethanol were applied as the substrates, the reactions provided the products 24 and 25 in 68$\\%$ and 63$\\%$yields, respectively. Gratifyingly, a series of 2-heteroarylethanols, such as alcohols containing thiophene (26, 27), furan(28), pyridine (29), an unprotected indole (30), benzothiophene (31), and benzofuran (32), all underwent the $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylation smoothly and successfully to deliver the desired products in moderate to good yields.\n25546\nIn addition to ethanol-based substrates, alcohols with a longer alkyl chain also proved to be suitable substrates (3344). Notably, alcohols with cyclic moieties, including six-(40 and 41), five-(42 and 43), and even strained three-membered rings (44), could all be used in this reaction system. Importantly, the reaction was not restricted to the use of primary alcohols, as secondary alcohols were also proven to be suitable substrates, where the desired products were furnished in moderate to good yields (45 and 46). Next, we were delighted to find that this phosphinomethylation occurs also with alcohols derived from several bioactive compounds, such as dihydrocholesterol (47), lithocholic acid(48),(S)-naproxen\n(49), and ibuprofen (50), which demonstrates the broader applicability of this manganese catalytic system.\nFurthermore, our methodology was also effectively applied to various aromatic phosphines (Scheme 2). The substituted diphenylphosphines with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, including methyl, methoxy, and chloro, all provided the desired $\\gamma -$ hydroxy phosphine products with good yields (51-54). Employing di(naphthalen-2-yl)phosphine as the substrate delivered the corresponding phosphinomethylated product 55 in 87$\\%$ yield. Moreover, we find that this phosphinomethylation process is not limited to aromatic phosphines. Indeed, aliphatic phosphines, such as diisopropylphosphine and dicyclohexylphosphine, are suitable substrates as well, providing the corresponding phosphinomethylated products in good yields (56,57).\nTo demonstrate the synthetic utility of this developed transformation, the $\\gamma -$ hydroxy phosphine 3 was applied as a useful building block for the construction of functionalized phosphine-containing compounds. As depicted in Scheme 3, straightforward access to $\\gamma -$ ester (58), ether (59) and thioether(63) phosphines, as well as bisphosphine compounds (60 and 62), were successfully realized in high efficiency.24\nConsidering the exceptional ability of the manganese pincer complex for the catalytic $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylation reaction, we were attracted in investigating the mechanism of this transformation (Figure 2). Using $CD_{3}$ OD instead of $CH_{3}OH$ resulted in deuterium incorporation in the $\\alpha -, \\beta -$ ,and $\\gamma -$ positions, which provided support for a BH mechanism(Figure 2a). Additionally, a set of control experiments was performed by subjecting potential reaction intermediates. The reaction of 3-phenyl-1-propanol (1b) with paraformaldehyde afforded a moderate yield of the desired product 35 (Figure 2b),which is probably due to the limited solubility of paraformaldehyde. Considering the fast self-condensation of 3phenylpropanal (64b) in the presence of a strong base, an experiment was conducted by dropwise addition of the mixture \\space $Ph_{Ph_{2}}$ \\space $\\overset{H_{3}B}{\\frown}PPh_{2}\\\\ Ph_{2}$ \\space Ph \\space BH3 \\space Ph \\space 59,82$\\%$ \\space $BH_{3}62,77 $\\%$$ \\space 0 \\space Ph \\space $\\uparrow \\begin{matrix}Phenol \\\\ PPh_{3}\\\\ DEAD \\end{matrix}$ \\space $\\uparrow \\begin{matrix}KOtBu \\\\ HPPh_{2}\\\\ BH_{3}THF \\end{matrix}$ \\space Br \\space Ph2 \\space PhCOCI \\space $\\overline{\\overset{OH}{Ph_{2}}}$ \\space $\\overset{NBS}{PPh_{3}}$ \\space Ph2 \\space Ph \\space $BH_{3}$ \\space $NEt_{3}$ \\space Ph \\space Ph \\space BH3 \\space BH3 \\space 58,99$\\%$ \\space $BH_{3}$ THF\n61,94$\\%$\n$\\boxed{\\left | \\begin{matrix}CIPPh_{2}\\\\ Et_{3}N \\\\ BH_{3}THF \\end{matrix}\\right .}$\n$|_{NaOH}^{\\text{NaSEt}}$\n$H_{3}B$ 、 $PPh_{2}$\n0\nSEt $Ph_{2}$\nPh\n$Ph_{2}\\\\ Ph_{2}H_{3}$\nPh\nBH3\n60,94$\\%$\n63,77$\\%$\nof 64b and methanol to the catalytic system, which furnished the product in 30$\\%$ yield, as well as some unidentified byproducts (Figure 2c). However, a 10$\\%$ yield of the product was observed when 64b was added in one portion. Furthermore, the reaction using 2-benzylacrylaldehyde (65b) to replace 3-phenylpropanal (1b) and methanol was performed since such $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated carbonyl compounds can be easily formed by cross-condensation/dehydration of aldehydes. The corresponding Michael addition product 66b was observed in 54$\\%$ yield via dropwise addition of 65b, which was unaffected by the absence or presence of the manganese catalyst (Figure 2d). While no corresponding product could be detected when 65b was introduced in one portion. These observations suggested that the corresponding aldehydes and $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated carbonyl compounds might be possible reaction\n25548\nintermediates, and the fast Michael addition step did not require the manganese catalyst. In addition, kinetic studies were performed to evaluate the order of each component(Figures S17-S20). The reaction exhibited a zero-order dependence on the concentration of alcohol 1 and phosphine 2, and first-order dependence on the concentration of MeOH and manganese catalyst. Based on the time course experiment and kinetic studies, we proposed that the manganese-catalyzed dehydrogenation of MeOH was involved in the ratedetermining step. $^{24}$\nAccording to the mechanistic observations, a plausible reaction pathway is proposed. First, the catalytically active amido manganese complex Mn-N is generated from the MACHO-Mn precatalyst in the presence of KOtBu. Subsequently, the resuiting manganese complex-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols 1 and methanol took place, thereby delivering the corresponding aldehyde 64, formaldehyde, $H_{2},$ and manganese hydride complex Mn- $C.^{17,23e,25}$ Of note, secondary phosphine 2 could also react with Mn-N to generate a phosphine coordinated manganese species (Mn-D), which suggested P-H bond could be activated by Mn-N (Figure S8). However, the phosphine group in Mn-D could be replaced by the alkoxy group to form Mn-A/B in the presence of an excess amount of alcohol(Figure $S9).^{24}$ Then Mn-A/B underwent dehydrogenation to afford aldehydes for the late transformation. Afterward, basepromoted cross aldol condensation between aldehyde 64 and formaldehyde leads to the formation of $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated carbonyl compound 65, which could react with phosphine to provide $\\beta -$ phosphino aldehyde 66. The desired phosphinomethylated product was then afforded via further hydrogenation of the formed aldehyde (Figure 2e). Importantly, the formed hydrogen gas could be used as the source of other hydrogenation reactions.25\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a manganese-catalyzed three-component $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylation of alcohols using methanol as the C1 source for the synthesis of $\\gamma -$ hydroxy phosphines via a hydrogen borrowing hydrogen strategy. A variety of $\\beta -H$ containing aromatic and aliphatic substituted alcohols and phosphines could undergo the cross-coupling process efficiently and deliver the corresponding $\\beta -$ phosphinomethylated alcohols in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic investigations indicated that this transformation proceeds through a cascade reaction sequence involving catalytic dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, Michael addition, and catalytic hydrogenation.\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nsi Supporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c10484.\nAdditional experimental details, materials, methods, and NMR spectra for all compounds (PDF)\nAccession Codes\nCCDC 2296109 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

However, the design of reactions involving metal carbynoids that exhibit carbene/carbocation behavior is currently limited, and developing catalyst-controlled highly enantioselective versions poses significant challenges. In this study, we present the first asymmetric trifunctionalization reactions with rhodium carbynoids. This reaction unveils the distinctive reactivity of the carbynoid precursor, enabling it to react with simultaneously two nucleophiles and one electrophile. This process involves the formation of two distinct carbene ylides with the alcohol/carbamate and the trapping of one ylide with the imine, resulting in the formation of three new bonds. Furthermore, this strategy allows for the divergent synthesis of a wide array of $\\beta -$ amino esters in high yields and exceptional enantioselectivity.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMultifunctionalization with active intermediates has been considered an efficient way to produce chemically diverse compounds and provides tools for the functionalization of complex molecular scaffolds. In view of the great success in difunctionalization with carbene $species^{2}$ (Scheme 1Aa), there is no doubt that carbynoids (R-C:+), which bear both carbene and carbon cation behavior, hold great potential for chemical transformation and will open a new avenue for organic synthesis and beyond. $^{3}$ In theory, these active intermediates have the potential to undergo reactions with two nucleophiles and one electrophile, enabling the formation of up to three sigma bonds on a single $carbon^{4}$ (Scheme 1Ab). Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of successful transformations regarding the utilization of these active intermediates, $^{5}$ and their application in catalytic transfer reactions remains largely unexplored due to the limited availability of suitable carbynoid precursors and the difficulties in precisely controlling reactivity and selectivity.. Recently, Suero and co-workers investigated the cationic carbyne reactivity of Rh(II)-carbynoids derived from hypervalent iodine diazo reagents. It is revealed that these carbynoids can undergo cyclopropanation or cyclopropenation with alkenes or alkynes, which are then intercepted by various nucleophiles. The step-wise trifunctionalization of metal carbynoids efficiently gives a series of synthetically valuable allyl and cyclopropene compounds, respectively. There are no asymmetric multicomponent $reactions^{8}$ involving metal carbynoid or its equivalents being reported so far.\nOur research group has been actively investigating the metal carbene difunctionalization reactions, focusing on the trapping of active ylide/zwitterionic intermediates with electrophilic reagents in recent years (Scheme 1B). Inspired by these advancements, we envisioned a novel metal carbynoid-ylidemetal carbene-ylide-electrophilic trapping process. This design involves the use of metal carbynoid precursors, nucleophiles containing heteroatoms, and carefully selected electrophiles. In this process, metal carbynoids with carbynoid properties are initially generated through the metal-catalyzed decomposition of leaving-group-associated diazo reagents. Subsequently, the nucleophile directly attacks the metal carbynoids, resulting in the generation of ylide I and the formation of a new electrondeficient heteroatom metal carbene by the departure of the leaving group. This intermediate can further be trapped by another molecule of the nucleophile, forming a ylide, which can then be captured by selected electrophiles. This sequence ultimately leads to the formation of three sigma bonds on a single carbon. Several challenges must be addressed to successfully accomplish this process, with the key focus on both the generation and the control of the new Fischer-type carbenes.\nAmong various Fischer-type carbenes, electron-rich heteroatom metal carbenes have received much attention, and various synthetic applications have been developed, especially with Group 6 metal carbene complexes. $^{10}$ Moreover, latetransition-metal-catalyzed transformations with non-Group 6 Fischer carbenes have also garnered significant attention, and various synthetically useful transformations have been\n26403\nArticle\n$achieved^{11}$ (Scheme 1CI). However, due to the limitation of carbene precursors and challenges in controlling the reactivity, electron-deficient heteroatom metal carbenes remain relatively unexplored (Scheme 1CII). Recently, Suero and colleagues demonstrated that Rh(II)-carbynoids, derived from hypervalent iodine diazo reagents, can be targeted by carboxylic acids containing alkenyl groups. This interaction results in the formation of acyloxy Rh-carbene species, which subsequently engage in intramolecular cyclopropanations to produce cyclopropyl-fused lactones. During the submission of this manuscript, Huang and his colleagues utilized a mixed I(III)/S(VI)-ylides reagent as a precursor to generate novel $\\alpha -$ heteroatom-substituted $(S-, \\space \\dot{O}-,$ and N-) metal carbenes. These newly formed carbenes then underwent an additional insertion process, providing a convenient approach to access a broad spectrum of heteroatom-functionalized carbonyl compounds.13 Notably, both of the aforementioned processes were reported in a racemic fashion.\nInspired by our three-component reactions of metal carbene difunctionalization via yilde trapping processes, $^{1a,14}$ here we present novel rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid cocatalyzed asymmetric multicomponent trifunctionalization reactions of hypervalent iodine diazo reagents as carbyne equivalents with alcohols/carbamates and imines and give $\\alpha -$ disubstituted chiral $\\beta -$ amino $esters^{15}$ in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (Scheme 1D). This reaction is believed to be proceeded by trapping of active intermediates derived from electrondeficient Fischer-type heteroatom carbene species, and the reaction mechanism has been investigated through a combination of experimental and computational studies\n2.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn our initial investigations, we focused on probing the reactivity of the proposed active ylide intermediates, which were derived from hypervalent iodine diazo compounds 1 and benzyl alcohol 2a, through trapping with various electrophiles(Scheme 2). While many electrophiles, including aldehydes, ethyl glyoxylate, and Michael acceptors, displayed limited\nreactivity, the use of imine 3a and isatins 3'a provided a more favorable outcome. Specifically, these reactions afforded the desired multifunctionalized products 4a and 4'a in 34 and 35$\\%$yield, respectively, in the presence of 5.0mol$\\%$ $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}.$ Moreover, we explored the impact of the diazo compound's structure on the reaction. Notably, the cyclic derivative 1b, which had previously exhibited poor reactivity in cyclization reactions, $^{5b,7}$ demonstrated enhanced reactivity, resulting in improved yields of 45 and 42$\\%$. Conversely, the corresponding linear reagent 1c yielded only minimal amounts of the target compounds.\n2.1. Reaction Optimization. Building on our success in the asymmetric Mannich-type trapping of active ylide/zwitterionic intermediates through a metal/chiral Bronsted acid cooperative catalysis system, $^{16}$ next, we extended our efforts by introducing chiral phosphoric acid to enhance the trapping efficiency by activating the imine electrophile 3 to achieve the enantioselective control. After a thorough optimization of the reaction conditions, involving the choice\n26404\nof various metal catalysts and chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs), solvents, and temperature adjustments, the best results were achieved at $-20 \\space ^{\\circ}C$ using spinol-type chiral phosphoric acid 5a with $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}.$ This led to the formation of the desired $\\beta -$ amino esters 4a in a remarkable 95$\\%$ yield and 92$\\%$ ee. (For further details, please refer to the Supporting Information.)\n2.2. Substrate Scope. Under the optimized conditions for the asymmetric version of this multicompound reaction, various of the ester groups of the hypervalent iodine diazo reagents were first explored to react with benzyl alcohol 2a and imine 3a (Table 1A). It was found that all of them can provide desired products successfully and brominated alkyl eater gave similar results in 90$\\%$ yield with 94$\\%$ ee. However, an almost racemic product was detected when the bulky tBu ester group was employed. Next, different functionalized alcohols 2 were examined (Table 1B). Gratifying, substituted alcohols that bear electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the different positions of the phenyl moiety were all compatible, forming the desired chiral $\\beta$ amino esters 4g-4o in high yields with 90-94$\\%$ ee. Reactions with alcohols that contain\n26405\nArticle\nAr\nN2\n$Rh_{2}$ (Oct $)_{4}(2.0$ mol$\\%$)\n$R^{1}O_{2}C$\n$\\frac{5a(13.0 \\space mol $\\%$)}{DCM,4A \\space\\text{MS,}- 20 ^\\circ\\text{C}}$ $_{R^{2}HN}^{R^{2}HN}>$\n0\n$2 \\space R^{2}NH_{2}$\n$Ar^{1}$\nOH\nO\nR10\n0\n-Ar\n\"0\n1\n6\n3\n7\n(S)-5a: Ar = 9-anthracene\nnaphthalene, benzodioxole rings, cycloalkyl, and trimethylsilyl(TMS) groups also proceeded well to deliver products 4p-4t in 75-92$\\%$ yields and 82-92$\\%$ ee. Notably, in contrast to previous reports, $^{7,12}$ alkyl and alkene-substituted alcohols also exhibited excellent reactivity in this reaction. They afforded products 4u-4v in high $\\dot{7}4-81 $\\%$$ yields, accompanied by outstanding stereoselectivity. Furthermore, natural alcohols, such as geraniol and (-)-perillyl alcohol gave us the desired products 4w and 4x in 80-85$\\%$ yields with excellent stereoselectivity (90$\\%$ ee or >20:1 dr), respectively. Notably, diol is also tolerated in this transformation and forms 1,3 dioxocyclic compounds 4y in 56$\\%$ yield with high 88$\\%$ ee. However, the secondary alcohol, tertiary alcohol, did not form any desired products under this current reaction conditions which might be due to the steric hindrance during the Mannich-type electrophilic trapping step.\nSubsequently, we proceeded to investigate the substrate scope of imines 3 in conjunction with diazo compound 1b and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol 2b (Table 1C). Remarkably, a diverse range of functional groups on the aryl rings of the imines were found to be well-tolerated, leading to the formation of Mannich-type addition products 4 with exceptional enantioselectivity and good to high yields. Specifically, imines 3 with benzaldehyde units at different positions, including electron-neutral and electron-withdrawing groups, successfully yielded the desired products 4ad-4aj in yields ranging from 83 to 93$\\%$ with a good enantiomeric excess. Additionally, electron-donating OMe-substituted aromatic aldimine was explored and resulted in the desired product 4ak in 95$\\%$ yield, albeit with slightly lower 76$\\%$ ee. The reactions proceeded smoothly for imines derived from 2thiophene and 2-naphthaldehyde, affording products 4al and 4am, in good yields and high enantioselectivity, respectively. Furthermore, imines bearing various substituents on the aniline unit ( $Ar^{2}),$ including hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, and methoxy groups, exhibited excellent reactivity, resulting in the formation of products 4an-4ay with yields ranging from 80 to 92$\\%$ and enantiomeric excess (93-98$\\%$). The stereochemistry of 4z and 4ae were determined as S by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and other compounds were assigned tentatively by analogy.\nAfter successfully conducting the CPA-catalyzed trifunctionalization with rhodium carbynoids through the interception of oxonium ylides, our attention turned to establishing the catalytic asymmetric version of this transformation with ammonium ylides. We initiated this investigation by subjecting diazo reagents 1b, $CbzNH_{2}\\space 6a,$ and imine 3aw, and the optimization of the reaction conditions was carefully explored and summarized in the Supporting Information. Under the optimized conditions, desired product 7a was obtained in 72$\\%$\n26406\nArticle\nyield with 97$\\%$ ee. Subsequently, we explored the reactivity of various ester groups first (Table 2) and all of these esters successfully provided the desired products 7a-7e with consistently high enantioselectivity, yielding 68-76$\\%$ with enantiomeric excesses of 95-97$\\%$. Further investigation involved studying a wide range of imines in the reactions including the aromatic groups on the aniline unit and aldehyde unit, different electronic properties, and substitution patterns, which were well-tolerated, leading to the formation of products 7f-7s in good yields (61-72$\\%$) and high enantioselectivity(78-99$\\%$ ee). Moreover, tert-butyl carbamate was found to be compatible, allowing the synthesis of the desired $\\beta -$ amino esters 7t in a yield of 61$\\%$ with an excellent enantiomeric excess of 98$\\%$.\n2.3. Mechanistic Studies. To gain insight into the mechanism and the origin of the selectivity control of this new process, several control experiments were carried out. Initially, we introduced $Rh_{2}(R-$ PTTL) $_{4}$ and $Rh_{2}(S-$ PTTL) $_{4}$ as the chiral catalyst along with racemic phosphoric acid separately, and both resulted in the formation of the corresponding product 4g in a high yield. However, the enantioselectivity was less than 5$\\%$ ee. In contrast, the use of CPA(S)-5a instead of the racemic PPA led to a high yield of 82$\\%$ with an excellent 92$\\%$ ee (Scheme 3A).

The reaction between substrate 1 and $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}$ extrudes the $N_{2}$ yielding the Rh(II)-carbynoid complex Cat-Rh. Starting with the key carbynoid species, PMBOH nucleophilically attacks carbynoid Cat-Rh via transition state TS1 with a calculated free energy of 2.9 kcal/mol. The transition state TS1 results in metal-alkyl ylide intermediate IM1 (-5.4 kcal/mol) or tautomeric isomer enol intermediate IM1-iso (5.7 kcal/mol). The calculation results suggest that the metal-alkyl ylide intermediate IM1 is more stable than the enol intermediate IM1-iso by 11.1 kcal/mol. Initiated by IM1, there are two possible pathways to generate the enantioselective products (pathway A in red, and pathway B in blue). In pathway A, the metal-alkyl ylide intermediate IM1 undergoes a facile dissociation of the iodine group to furnish the Rh(II)-carbene intermediate A-IM2(-66.4 kcal/mol), with the strong driving force caused by the reduction of $I^{III}$ to $I^{I}.$ An alternative pathway is a stepwise process, in which the iodine intermediate IM2 (-35.2 kcal/mol) is first formed by the dissociation of the $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4},$ and then the $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}$ may react with IM2 to form the Rh(II)carbene intermediate A-IM2. The carbene intermediate A-IM2 promotes the formation of the metal-alkyl intermediate AIM3 through the addition of another PMBOH via transition state A-TS2 (-66.0 kcal/mol). Then, the tautomerisor of AIM3 interacts with imine 3ae and CPA to form the ylide reactant complex A-IM4 (-96.4 kcal/mol). On the contrary in pathway B, IM1 directly interacts with the imine and CPA to obtain intermediate B-IM2 (-52.5 kcal/mol, as shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), which is much less stable than intermediate A-IM4 (-96.4 kcal/mol), suggesting the reaction via the Rh(II)-carbynoid intermediate A-IM2(pathway A) is more favorable for the enantioselective generation of the product. Following the metal-alkyl intermediate A-IM4, the enantioselective product formation occurs via the competition between transition state A-TS $3_{P}$ (-90.0 kcal/mol) and transition state A-TS $3_{S}(-91.6$ kcal/mol) leading to the R- and the S- products, respectively. The calculated ee value is 88$\\%$, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.\nTo determine the controlling factors on the enantioselectivity, the structures and key parameters of the transition states are depicted in Figure 2. The favored transition state A-TS $3_{S}$ has a strong $N-H \\cdots O$ hydrogen bond (1.865 A) between the imine and the CPA. Remarkably, the $N-H \\cdots O$ hydrogen bond and CPA compose a seven-number ring with the pfluorobenzene part of imine, leading to a short distance between the PO...H hydrogen bond (2.073 A), while the sixnumber ring is formed between the N-H...O hydrogen bond, benzene part of imine, and CPA, leading to a weak PO $\\cdots H$ hydrogen bond (the distance is 2.460 A). In comparison, transition state A-TS $3_{R}$ has longer distances for the O(Rh) ... H(imine) hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting in a higher free energy for transition state A-TS $3_{R}.$ The calculated results highlight the important role of hydrogen bonding in the enantioselectivity of the reaction, leading to a majority of the Sproduct, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations.\nBased on the above control experimental, DFT studies, and the recent studies, $^{12,13}$ we propose a plausible reaction mechanism, as depicted in Scheme 4. Initially, rhodium carbynoid A was formed via the reaction of diazo compound 1b with the rhodium complex. This intermediate then underwent nucleophilic attack by alcohol 2 or carbamate 6, resulting in the formation of Fischer-type carbene C with the\n26407\nArticle\ndeparture of the iodine motif. After that, the new generated carbene intermediate was trapped by another molecule of nucleophile to form ylide D. This intermediate could exist in equilibrium with its enol form E of F (without any association with the metal). This active intermediate was intercepted by electrophilic imines 3 in the presence of CPA, resulting in the successful delivery of the Mannich-type addition products 4 or 7 and the regeneration of the catalysts.\n2.4. Synthetic Applications. To demonstrate the synthetic value of this methodology, we further explored their transformations of readily produced $\\beta$ amino esters in the presence of commercially available reagents (Scheme 5). First, intramolecular amidation of 8k under the treatment of $Cs_{2}CO_{3}$ yielded the lactam 10 in a high 92$\\%$ yield. The Suzuki coupling reaction was also tolerated in this skeleton and produced furantype product 11 in 91$\\%$ yields. Additionally, the ester group was reduced to a hydroxy group by $LiAlH_{4}$ to yield aminol alcohol, which underwent cyclization with triphosgene and produced the oxazinanone 12 in good 82$\\%$ yield. Notably, no degradation of enantiomeric purity occurred in all of the above transformations.

This reaction reveals the unique metal carbyniod reactivity of the carbyne precursor reacting with two nucleophiles and one electrophile simultaneously. Two carbene ylide formations with the alcohol/carbamate and one ylide trapping reaction with the imine correspond to three bond formations. Electron-deficient Fischer-type heteroatom carbene is in situ generated, and its reactivity is realized for ylide formation and subsequent trapping process. Highly enantioselective control of the multicomponent reaction has been achieved to afford $\\beta -$ amino derivatives with broad substrate generality. The proposed reaction mechanism and the origin of the high enantioselectivity are rationalized by DFT calculation studies. This is the first example of catalytic asymmetric multifunctionalization reactions with rhodium carbynoids reactivity. Ongoing studies in our laboratory focus on exploring this intriguing reaction with other metal carbynoid precursors and their applications in enantioselective four-component reactions to access pharmaceutical relevant compounds\n26409\nArticle\nXiaoyan Yang - Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chiral Molecule and Drug Discovery, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, China\nComplete contact information is available at:\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/jacs.3c10460\nAuthor Contributions\n$^{\\$}Y.Q, \\space J.T., \\space X.Z.,$ and J.L. contributed equally.\nNotes\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe support for this research from the National Natural Science Foundation of China(22001268,21973113, 92256301, and 92056201), Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chiral Molecule and Drug Discovery(2023B1212060022),Guangdong Natural Science Fund(2023A1515011486), and Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2022B1111050003) is greatly acknowledged.\nREFERENCES\n(1)(a) Guo, X.; Hu, W.

Herein, we present the first example of the rational design, synthesis, and unique recognition properties of novel fullerenefunctionalized halogen-bonding (XB) heteroditopic ion-pair receptors containing cation and anion binding domains spatially separated by $C_{60}.$ Fullerene spatial separation of the XB donors and the crown ether complexed potassium cation resulted in a rare example of an artificial receptor containing two anion binding sites with opposing preferences for hard and soft halides. Importantly, the incorporation of the $C_{60}$ motif into the heteroditopic receptor structure has a significant effect on the halide binding selectivity, which is further amplified upon $K^{+}$ cation binding. The potassium cation complexed fullerene-based receptors exhibit enhanced selectivity for the soft polarizable iodide ion which is assisted by the $C_{60}$ scaffold preorganizing the potent XB-based binding domains, anion $- \\pi$ interactions, and the exceptional polarizability of the fullerene moiety, as evidenced from DFT calculations. These observations serve to highlight the unique properties of fullerene surfaces for proximal charged guest binding with potential applications in construction of selective molecular sensors and modulating the properties of solar cell devices.\nINTRODUCTION\nFullerenes are unique molecules with a large spherical surface, strong electron acceptor properties, high electric polarizability, and curved $\\pi -$ electron systems capable of forming noncovalent interactions with electron-rich molecules. $^{1-13}$ As a result, they have been incorporated in numerous functional molecular assemblies and supramolecular arrays with a wide variety of applications in photochemistry, medicinal chemistry, and organic electronics. $^{14-26}$ Although molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces of simple fullerenes are positive, surprisingly, their interaction with anions has been largely overlooked. $^{6,27}$ Only recently, Matile and co-workers demonstrated remarkable examples of the stabilization of anionic transition states in anion $- \\pi$ catalysis on a fullerene surface, $^{28-30}$ while Lei and co-workers reported facilitated charge transfer in solid-state aggregates of self-n-doped fullerene ammonium iodide, which is believed to be a result of iodide- $C_{60}$ interactions. $^{31}$ However, thus far fullerene surfaces have not been exploited as potential supramolecular host platforms for the recognition of simple anions (e.g., halides) in molecular receptor structural design. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that an open-cage fullerene was demonstrated as a molecular container for $F^{-}, \\space Cl^{-},$ and $I^{-}.^{32}$\nThe MEP surface of $C_{60}$ reveals highly localized areas of positive potential, $\\pi -$ holes (Figure 1), which can be presumably used in anion recognition. Anion $- \\pi$ interactions are widely recognized and frequently exploited in the design of selective anion binding receptors. $^{33-36}$ Strong attraction between an anion and a $\\pi -$ system can be achieved by electron-withdrawing substituents that further polarize the molecule and lead to a positive quadrupole moment along the axis perpendicular to the $\\pi -$ system, increasing the depth of a $\\pi -$ hole. $^{33}$ Interestingly, fullerenes are known for their remarkable $polarizability^{3}$ which, in principle, may enable a significant enhancement of anion $- \\pi$ interactions by exposure to an external electric field, produced for example by a proximate anion (so-called dynamic contribution) or cation. Moreover, the well-defined bulky architecture of fullerenes provides a potential scaffold for preorganization of binding motifs and a hydrophobic shield, which can create a microenvironment that excludes solvent molecules and enhances strength of noncovalent interactions. $^{38,39}$ Due to these features, $C_{60}$ constitutes an exceptional\n27367\nArticle\nand unexplored platform for the design and construction of heteroditopic ion-pair receptors with increased affinity and selectivity. The positive cooperativity associated with the simultaneous proximal binding of oppositely charged species has been crucial in augmenting the ion-pair binding properties of heteroditopic receptors relative to their monotopic receptor counterparts. As such, heteroditopic receptors have been increasingly employed in a myriad of applications including salt extraction and solubilization, $^{40,41}$ membrane transport, $^{42,43}$ and biological zwitterion binding. $^{44,45}$\nThe vast majority of reported heteroditopic receptors contain well-established recognition motifs such as crown ethers for cation recognition and hydrogen bond donors for anion complexation. $^{46-48}$ In recent years, however, halogen bonding (XB), an interaction between a Lewis base and the $\\sigma -$ hole of an electron-deficient halogen atom, has emerged as a powerful addition to the anion supramolecular host-guest chemistry toolbox, due to its stringent linearity, comparable binding strength to hydrogen bonding (HB), and distinctive selectivity. $^{49-52}$ Herein, we describe for the first time the rational design, synthesis, and unique recognition properties of\n27368\nArticle\nO\nOHC、\nOH\n(a)\nOHC、\nOH\n(b)\nOHC\n。\n$\\circ$\n(c)\nOH\n。\nCI\n$\\circ$\nCHO\nO\n3\n4\n。。\n5\nHO\nO\n$ROH_{2}C$ 、\n0\nO\n7\n$HOH_{2}C$ 、\n。\nO\n。\n。\nCH2OR\n(d)\n。\nO\nCH2OH\n。\n0\nR=\n8\nO\n6\no\n(e)\nO\nO\n9\n$NO_{2}$\nCI\n$NO_{2}$\nN3-\n$NO_{2}$\n$F_{3}C$\nCF3\n$\\frac{11}{(a)}$\n$\\frac{13}{(b)}$\n$F_{3}C$\n10\n$F_{3}C$\n12\nCF3\nCF3\n$_{14}^{X=C|}\\xrightarrow{(C)}$\n$X=N_{3}\\\\ 15$\n$1. \\leftarrow 9$\nnovel fullerene-functionalized halogen-bonding heteroditopic ion-pair receptors containing cation and anion binding domains spatially separated by $C_{60}$ (Figure 2).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSynthesis of Fullerene Heteroditopic lon-Pair Receptors. Interest in crown ether-fullerene adduct materials has been stimulated primarily by their photophysical, electrochemical, and superconducting properties. In particular, Echegoyen, Pretsch, Diederich, and co-workers obtained the $C_{60}-$ dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) adduct in a highly regioselective double cyclopropanation (Bingel addition) taking place exclusively in the trans-1 positions on the opposite poles of $C_{60}$ (Figure $3a).^{54,55}$ Potassium cation crown ether binding in the proximity of the fullerene surface was shown to elicit significant perturbations of the fullerene host's reduction potentials, proving that alkali metal cation complexation can alter the physicochemical properties of $C_{60}.$ We hypothesized that a complexed cation could further polarize the fullerene surface, resulting in anion binding enhancement on the opposite size of the molecule (Figure 2). Therefore, we adapted the regioselective DB18C6 double Bingel fullerene addition for the synthesis of heteroditopic ion-pair receptors 1 and 2 containing neutral acyclic XB donors based on 1,3bis(iodotriazole)nitroaryl motifs in the anion binding domains,spatially separated from the polarizable fullerene surface by linkers of different lengths (Figure 3b).\nThe separate appropriately functionalized crown etherfullerene cation and halogen-bonding anion binding domain synthons were prepared according to Schemes 1 and 2. The synthesis of the bis-alkyne appended crown ether-fullerene synthon 9 was achieved via modification of the regioselective procedure reported by Diederich and co-workers (Scheme $1).^{54}\\space 3,4-$ Dihydroxybenzaldehyde 3 was alkylated with an excess of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether to obtain 4(21$\\%$), which could be readily separated from the other regioisomer. Macrocyclization of 4 in the presence of the $K^{+}$ template afforded the poorly soluble trans-dialdehyde of DB18C6 5(31$\\%$),which upon reduction using $NaBH_{4}$ gave the diol 6\n27369\nArticle\n(62$\\%$). Monomalonate 7 was prepared either by treating 4pentyn-1-ol with Meldrum's acid (68$\\%$) or via an alternative approach involving selective monohydrolysis of a symmetric malonic ester (see the Supporting Information for details). Diol 6 was coupled with excess 7 using EDC to obtain bismalonate ester crown ether 8 (76$\\%$). Bingel reaction of 8 with $C_{60}$ in the presence of $K^{+}$ and $I_{2}$ led exclusively to doubly substituted fullerene adduct 9(25$\\%$). $The^{1}H$ NMR $and^{13}C$ NMR spectra of 9 (Figures S5 and S6)were in agreement with the trans-1 addition pattern $(C_{2}$ symmetry), which was later unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction structural analysis (Figure 4).57 Solid-state analysis also\nrevealed that the DB18C6 ester groups of the cyclopropane rings are situated on the same side of the fullerene (out-out isomer). Interestingly, rotation of the crown ether moiety is significantly limited, causing planar chirality and splitting of the benzylic and ether $CH_{2}$ signals in $the^{1}H$ NMR spectrum (see Figure S5).\nThe synthesis of the azide-functionalized XB anion binding domain 15 required desymmetrization of bis-iodoalkyne building block io (Scheme 2). An excess of 10 was treated with azide 11 in the presence of [Cu(MeCN) $_{4}]PF_{6}$ and Cu(I) stabilizing ligand TBTA to obtain mono-iodotriazole 12(65$\\%$). It was then reacted with azide 13 to obtain asymmetric bis-iodotriazole 14 (72$\\%$), which could be readily transformed into azide 15 (60$\\%$). In the final step, the anion binding moiety was doubly ``clicked'' with bis-alkyne crown ether fullerene adduct 9 to obtain ion-pair receptor 1 following purification by flash and size-exclusion chromatography (36$\\%$).\nThe synthesis of receptor 2 with a shorter linker between the anion binding domain and the fullerene surface was initiially attempted in an alternative approach with a Bingel reaction conducted on precursor 16 (Scheme 3). Unfortunately, this resulted in a complex mixture of products, suggesting that the anion binding motif is not compatible with the conditions of the cyclopropanation reaction. An alternative route involving Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction between alkyne 12 and DB18C6-fullerene bis-azide 18 proved successful (Scheme 3). Fullerene azides are known to be highly unstable due to possible reactions at the fullerene surface. $^{58-60}$ However, a Bingel reaction of short duration time between 17 and $C_{60},$ followed by rapid chromatographic purification afforded 18, which was used immediately in the next step to obtain final receptor 2 (14$\\%$).\nAnion and lon-Pair Binding Studies. The anion binding properties of fullerene containing heteroditopic receptors 1 and 2 were investigated $by^{1}H$ NMR titration experiments in 3:1 $CDCl_{3}:CD_{3}$ CN. Addition of TBA halides ( $Cl^{-}$ , $Br^{-},I^{-})$ to solutions of the free receptors 1 or 2 caused significant shifts of the XB anion binding domain proton signals, and no changes $(\\Delta \\delta <0.01$ ppm) of the crown ether cation binding protons were observed. Such a behavior strongly indicates that the ditopic binding domains of receptors 1 and 2 are electronically and spatially well-separated from each other. Notably, the respective receptor's internal nitroaryl proton (a) shifted downfield, which is indicative of halide binding in a cavity formed by the iodotriazole XB donors (Figure 5). Bindfit analysis of the titration isotherm data revealed that 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometric host-guest complexes are formed (Table $1).^{61,62}$ In the 1:1 complex, the halide anion is most likely bound by both bidentate XB motifs, contributing up to four halogen bond donors. Upon addition of excess halide anion, each appended XB bidentate recognition site binds an individual anion with two halogen bond donors to form a 1:2 stoichiometric host-guest complex. Unsurprisingly then, $K_{1:1}$ association constant values are more than an order of magnitude larger than those of $K_{1:2}.$ Receptor 1 binds halides more strongly than 2 with a selectivity trend of $Br^{-}>I^{-}>Cl^{-}.$ The enhanced halide anion binding by 1 may be attributed to the longer, flexible linker providing the conformational freedom to facilitate the formation of stronger XB-halide anion interactions in the 1:1 complex. Control receptor 16, which does not contain fullerene, exhibits a halide selectivity trend mirroring that of 1, however with lower $K_{1:1}$ values. Interestingly, receptor 2 exhibits a unique, however modest, preference for $I^{-}$ over $Br^{-}$ and $Cl^{-}$ which may be a result of a shorter distance between the XB binding units and the fullerene surface. The combination of the $C_{60}$ fullerene scaffold's preorganization of the two XB anion binding arms proximal to the hydrophobic fullerene surface and possible additional anion $- \\pi$ interactions are most likely responsible for the enhanced binding of 1 and a unique iodide binding selectivity of 2.\nDibenzo-18-crown-6 is known for its high affinity for potassium cations. Therefore, the $K^{+}$ binding properties of the fullerene containing receptors 1 and 2 were also investigated $by^{1}H$ NMR titration experiments in 3:1 $CDCl_{3}:CD_{3}$ CN. Addition of $KBAr_{4}^{F}$ to solutions of free receptors 1 or 2 resulted in significant perturbations of the crown ether cation binding domain chemical shifts. With the first aliquots of $KBAr_{4}^{F},$ notable signal broadening was observed, and a new set of signals emerged due to slow exchange on the NMR time scale (Figure 6). In particular, the aromatic proton signals of the receptor's DB18C6 motif experienced notable downfield shifts $(\\Delta \\delta \\approx 0.10$ ppm), concomitant with - $OCH_{2}-$ crown ether perturbations, which due to significant broadening were difficult to follow. After 1.4 equiv of $K^{+},$ however, no further changes were observed, which is indicative of strong binding in a 1:1 stoichiometric hostguest complex. Importantly, no significant changes $(\\Delta \\delta <0.01$ ppm) were observed in the proton signals of the XB anion binding domains of both receptors. This observation further corroborates a good separation of the anion binding domain from the cation one.\nTo investigate the ion-pair binding properties of receptors 1 and 2, halide $anion^{1}H$ NMR titration experiments in the presence of 1 equiv of $KBAr_{4}^{F}$ were undertaken. Addition of TBAI to a solution of $K^{+}$ complexed 1 or 2 caused perturbations of the XB anion binding sites, confirming that XB donors are involved in anion binding. In fact, these shift\n27370\nArticle\npatterns were qualitatively similar to those observed during titrations of the free receptors. However, small changes were also observed in the - $OCH_{2}-$ proton signals of the crown ether cation binding domain. Notably, the downfield perturbations of the - $OCH_{2}-$ crown ether signals around 3.90 ppm were larger during titrations with bromide and even greater with chloride (Figure 7). This perturbation pattern cannot be explained by simple potassium cation decomplexation of the crown ether and precipitation of the potassium halide salt (compare with the spectra shown in Figure 6).\nThe aforementioned observations suggest that crown ether bound $K^{+}$ is directly involved in complexation of the anions. Interestingly, a qualitatively similar perturbation pattern of the crown ether signals was also observed during analogous titrations of $K^{+}$ complexed $C_{60}-$ DB18C6 adduct 9, which does not contain a XB anion binding domain (Figure 7). In this case, however, the overall signal shifts were more pronounced. In the presence of 1 equiv of $KBAr_{4}^{F}$ receptor 9 forms 1:1 stoichiometric halide complexes with the preference for hard small anions: $Cl^{-}>Br^{-}>I^{-}$ in 3:1 $CDCl_{3}:CD_{3}$ CN,as determined by the Bindfit analysis of binding isotherms (Table 2). This assembly is driven predominantly by electrostatic interactions with the crown ether complexed potassium cation resulting in the formation of a close contact ion-pair.\nWe suspect that such a binding mode is also present during titrations of receptors 1 and 2 with halides, particularly harder ones such as Cl- and $Br^{-}.$ However, due to spatial separation of the cation and anion binding domains in receptors 1 and 2, two distinct types of 1:1 stoichiometric complex A and B can be simultaneously formed, contributing to the experimentally determined overall 1:1 association constants (Figure 8). In binding mode A, the anion is exclusively bound by the XB binding site, while in mode B the anion associates solely with the crown ether bound potassium cation in a contact ion-pair recognition fashion. $^{63,64}$ Similarly, upon excess addition of anion, two types of 1:2 stoichiometric complexes are possible: C, with two anions bound individually by the XB donor arms, and D, in which one anion is bound in a tetradentate XB fashion and the other anion is associating with the potassium cation (Figure 8).\nThis hypothesis was further corroborated by $the^{1}H$ NMR titration of $2 \\cdot K^{+}$ with $NO_{3}^{-},$ which exhibits strong preference for the close contact ion-pair formation(mode B). During the titration with $TBANO_{3}$ no changes were observed in the XB anion binding domain, while significant perturbation of the\n27371\nArticle\ncrown ether signals was observed until ca. 1.5 equiv of anion was added (Figure S38). Addition of up to 10 equiv of $NO_{3}^{-}$ had no further impact on the proton signals of $2 \\cdot K^{+},$ suggesting the oxoanion forms only the 1:1 stoichiometric anion complex of mode B. Interestingly, addition of 2 equiv of TBACl at the end of the titration with $NO_{3}^{-}(10$ equiv) induced perturbations of XB binding domain signals, and no changes of crown ether signals were observed. This confirms the independence of the anion binding sites and formation of type D complex with chloride occupying the XB binding domain and nitrate forming the contact ion-pair with the crown ether bound $K^{+}.$\nQuantitative analysis of the halide binding isotherms in the presence of 1 equiv of $KBAr_{4}^{F},$ using a 1:2 stoichiometric host-guest model, gave overall association constant values shown in Table 2, where $K_{1:1}$ represents the sum of 1:1 stoichiometric anion binding modes A and B and $K_{1:2}$ the sum of 1:2 stoichiometric anion binding modes C and D. Comparing Tables 1 and 2, the presence of the complexed\n27372\nArticle\n$^{a}$ Solvent: 3:1 $CDCl_{3}:CD_{3}$ CN at 298 K. Values reported as the mean and the standard error of the mean from independently repeated experiments. $^{b}$ Not formed.\n$K^{+}$ in the respective $C_{60}-$ DB18C6 cation binding domain of the XB receptors 1 and 2 results in a significant enhancement of halide association constants, particularly of $K_{1:1}.$ Importantly, it was possible to deconvolute and estimate the individual contributions of A and B halide binding modes to the overall $K_{1:1}$ association constant value through the analysis of the chemical shifts of the crown ether protons of receptors 1 and 2 and control receptor 9 during halide anion titrations in the presence of $KBAr_{4}^{F}$ (see the Supporting Information for details). In the case of 1, the binding mode A accounts for approximately 63$\\%$ of the overall 1:1 chloride association constant, 83$\\%$ of 1:1 bromide association constant, and more than 95$\\%$ of 1:1 iodide association constant, clearly showing the preference of the heavier softer halide anions toward fullerene-assisted XB binding. Further corroborating these estimates, the values of 1:1 association constants for mode B of receptors 1 and 2, obtained using this method, are in good agreement with the values obtained during titrations of control receptor 9, which is able to bind anions only via mode B.\nDeconvolution of the A and B binding modes of 1:1 association enabled a direct comparison of $K^{+}$ coordination\n27373\nArticle\neffects on the fullerene-assisted halide binding in the XB domain. The $K_{1:1}$ association constant values for anion binding mode $A(K_{1:1}^{A})$ of both heteroditopic receptors 1 and 2 are significantly increased in the presence of cobound $K^{+}$ (Table 3). Notably, the binding enhancement for iodide is particularly strong, resulting in a remarkably increased selectivity for this anion. In the case of receptor $2, \\space K_{1:1}^{A}$ association constants increased by a factor $\\alpha =2.2(\\alpha =K_{1:1}^{A}(K^{+})/K_{1:1})$ and 2.1 for chloride and bromide, respectively, while for iodide $\\alpha =5.2.$ Even stronger $I^{-}$ enhancement was observed for receptor $1(\\alpha$ =7.4); however, overall selectivity of 1 for $I^{-}$ vs other halides is reduced in comparison with 2. In the presence of cobound $K^{+}$ , control heteroditopic receptor 16, without the fullerene scaffold, binds all the halides significantly more strongly $(\\alpha =$ 12.7-13.5), however notably at the expense of much lower selectivity. This is most likely due to the formation of a close contact ion-pair, resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions. The remarkable properties and influence of $C_{60}$ for ion recognition are particularly evident in comparison of iodide binding affinity exhibited by 1 and 16. Impressively, the iodide $K_{1:1}$ association constant value of receptor 1, whose anion and cation binding domains are separated by the fullerene, almost matches the magnitude for receptor 16, which is capable of anion binding assisted by close contact with the crown ether cobound potassium cation. Importantly, this suggests that the polarizing $C_{60}$ surface can elicit particularly strong interactions with polarizable soft anion species such as iodide and can transfer electrostatic effects over significant distances within the fullerene heteroditopic host design.\nComputational Analysis. Having demonstrated the unique ion-pair recognition properties of fullerene-containing heteroditopic receptors 1 and 2, DFT calculations were undertaken to gain insight into the electronic and structural aspects of ion-pair complexation. In the computational analysis, we focused on receptor 2, which manifested the highest selectivity, presumably due to the closer proximity of the fullerene surface. DFT calculations in the gas-phase were performed with Gaussian $16,^{65}$ using the M06-2X functional, chosen for its ability to accurately describe halogen bonds and $\\pi - \\pi$ stacking interactions. $^{66-68}$ The Def2-SVP basis set was selected, $^{69}$ except for the anions and iodine binding units, which were described with the Def2-TZVPD basis set, 69,70 taken from the Basis Set Exchange website. 71-73 This combination was employed to balance the accurate description of the noncovalent interactions and the structural features of the large receptors 1 and 2.\nThe MEP surface of $C_{60}$ (Figure 1) exhibits distinct electrophilic regions, with $\\pi -$ holes situated above its 12 five-\n27374\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 27367-27379\nArticle\nmembered $(C_{5})$ rings and 20 six-membered $(C_{6})$ rings. These $\\pi -$ holes have molecular surface electrostatic potential $(V_{S})$ values ranging between 7.2 and 7.9 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ For comparison, 9 and its $K^{+}$ complex were also optimized by DFT (Figure 9). The DB18C6 motif in adduct 9 has a significant effect on the electrostatic potential map, resulting in a nearly negatively charged fullerene surface. The exposed surface of the fullerene displays several $\\pi -$ holes with $V_{s}$ values ranging between -5.5 and -0.2 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ The lowest $V_{S}$ values of 9 were found between the oxygen atoms of the crown ether cavity, varying between -58.6 and -57.5 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ The MEP surface of $9's \\space C_{60}$ moiety has an additional negative point of $V_{S}$ with -29.5 kcal $mol^{-1},$ perpendicular to the $C_{6}$ ring just below the crown ether. This electron-rich site is perfectly prepared for the coordination of $K^{+},$ as evidenced by a computed $K^{+}\\cdots C_{6}$ distance of 2.93 A in $9 \\cdot K^{+}.$ The potassium cation binding induces a significant redistribution of the electrostatic potential in 9, with the $C_{60}\\space \\pi -$ holes $'V_{S}$ values now ranging from 30.4 to 47.2 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ For comparison, typical $\\pi -$ hole donors trifluoro-1,3,5-triazene or hexafluorobenzene,74 investigated at the M06-2X/Def2-SVP theory level, respectively display $V_{S,max}$ values of 40.9 and 21.5 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ However, in complex $9 \\cdot K^{+},$ the $V_{S,max}$ of 111.8 kcal $mol^{-1}$ is found over the metal cation, which explains its strong tendency to form close putative ion-pair contacts with halides, as depicted in Figure S71 with the DFT optimized structures of $9 \\cdot K \\cdot X(X=$ Cl,Br,orI)complexes. $ThecomputedK^{+}\\cdots X^{-}$ distances ( $Cl^{-}:2.85$ ; $Br^{-}:3.02$ ; $I^{-}:3.23 \\space A)$ mirror the anion's size, with the shortest contact corresponding to the highest association constant, found for $9 \\cdot$ KCl (Table 2).\nThe starting geometries of 1 and 2 were generated via crude gas-phase MD simulations of KCl complexes, enforcing halogen bonds through geometric restraints, as detailed in the Supporting Information. Multiple conformations were selected and subsequently subjected to geometry optimizations using DFT. Figure 10 shows the optimized structures of chloride complexes of 2 with potassium hosted within the DB18C6 cation binding domain for the A-D anion binding scenarios, consistent with the binding modes hypothesized based $on^{1}H$ NMR titrations, while Figures S72 and S73 show equivalent optimized binding arrangements for bromide and iodide.\nPotassium binding by the DB18C6 moiety can be characterized by $K^{+}...C_{6}$ distances summarized in Table S7. In scenarios A and C, the average $K^{+}\\cdots C_{6}$ distance is ca. 3 \\text{\\AA}, whereas in binding mode B, the ca. 3.5 A average $K^{+}\\cdots C_{6}$ distance is significantly larger. Due to the close ion-pair contact in B, the anion pulls $K^{+}$ from the crown ether, weakening the\n27375\nArticle\npotential interaction with the fullerene surface. $^{54}$ Interestingly, in scenario D, the $K^{+}\\cdots C_{6}$ distances have intermediate values between those computed for B and A/C, showing that binding in one domain can influence the behavior on the opposite side.\nIn binding mode A, the four convergent halogen bonds with chloride are not equivalent (Table S8). Two interactions have an average I... $Cl^{-}$ distance of 3.35 A and an average C-I... $Cl^{-}$ angle of $163^{\\circ},$ while the other two interactions are nearly linear with distances of 3.03 A and angles of $173^{\\circ},$ consistent with highly directional $\\sigma -$ hole XB interactions. The XB distances and angles in the bromide $(3.58 \\space A,162^{\\circ}$ ; $3.21 \\space A,174^{\\circ})$ and iodide $(3.83 \\space A,162^{\\circ}$ ; $3.43 \\space A,176^{\\circ})$ complexes follow a similar pattern, adjusted for the sizes of the ions (Table S8). This asymmetry is not surprising considering the differences in the iodotriazole units of the anion binding domain. One is directly connected to a strong electron-withdrawing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group, while the other is connected to an electron-rich alkyl-substituted phenyl. Importantly, the halogen-bonding anions' recognition is assisted by anion $- \\pi$ interactions with short contacts between the fullerene surface and each anion, leading to the trend of $C_{6}\\cdots X^{-}$ distances $Cl^{-}$ (3.13 \\text{\\AA})< $Br^{-}(3.35 \\space \\dot{A})<I^{-}(3.63 \\space A).$\nAfter optimization of the putative binding arrangements for the recognition of halides in binding modes A-D, the MEP maps of 2 and $2 \\cdot K^{+}$ were evaluated through single-point DFT calculations. To achieve this, we used the optimized structure of the $Cl^{-}$ association in scenario D and removed the necessary ions (Figure 11). The most negative region of electrostatic\npotential on the electronic surface of 2 covers the oxygen atoms of the crown ether (including the $V_{S,min}$ of -45.8 kcal $mol^{-1}),$ while the most positive regions are found in front of the iodine binding clefts, with their $\\sigma -$ holes characterized by $V_{s}$ values of 43.6 and 44.3 kcal $mol^{-1}$ and of 48.2 and 48.3 kcal $mol^{-1}$ for the iodo-triazole unit activated by neighboring - $CF_{3}$ groups. Complexation of $K^{+}$ in the cation binding domain of 2 leads to a significant redistribution of the MEP surface. Naturally, the $V_{S,max}$ of 130.2 kcal $mol^{-1}$ is located over the cation; however, the four XB units display augmented $V_{s}$ values between 75.3 and 79.7 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ Notably, an $V_{S}$ point of 61.5 kcal $mol^{-1}$ was found positioned over the $C_{6}$ ring in the vicinity of the preorganized XB binding units.\nThe strength of the XB interactions in different binding modes was further evaluated with the natural bond orbital(NBO) analysis using the second-order perturbation theory interaction energies $(E^{2},$ see Table S9). The analysis of the $E^{2}$ values for the interactions between the C-I antibonding orbitals of 2 and the halides' lone pairs orbitals $(n_{X}\\rightarrow \\sigma ^{*}_{C-I})$ revealed that in binding mode A the total energies follow the trend $Cl^{-}(37.5$ kcal $mol^{-1})>Br^{-}(36.3$ kcal $mol^{-1})>I^{-}(33.1$ kcal $mol^{-1}).$ Asimilar analysis was also performed for the interactions between the fullerene scaffold $'s \\space \\pi -$ holes and the three halides in binding modes A and D, revealing that $E^{2}$ values resulting from $n_{X}\\rightarrow \\sigma ^{*}_{C-C}$ are over an order of magnitude weaker (0.5-1.3 kcal $mol^{-1})$ than the XB interactions.\nAlthough the computational analysis suggests that in the gas phase binding mode B is preferred for 2 by 3.0 ( $Cl^{-}), \\space 5.1$ ( $Br^{-}),$ and 6.2 kcal $mol^{-1}(I^{-}),$ it is worth noting that in the case of $1 \\cdot$ KCl, binding mode A is favored by 24.9 kcal $mol^{-1}$ relative to B (Figure $S74).^{75}$ In this complex, however, the halide does not form a contact with the fullerene surface, and the receptor adopts a conformation that maximizes the strength of the halogen bonding.\nAltogether, the computational analysis reveals that the fullerene platform can play a dual role in anion binding by receptors 1 and 2. Indeed, it can be actively involved in the binding events by exploiting $\\pi -$ holes on its surface, but it can also serve as a bulky scaffold to preorganize the potent XBbased binding units into a tight binding cavity.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor the first time, the $C_{60}$ fullerene motif has been successfully integrated into a heteroditopic ion-pair host design. The combination of highly potent XB donors and a crown ether moiety separated by $C_{60}$ led to the rationally designed receptors with ion-pair binding properties influenced and modulated by the fullerene motif. Receptors 1 and 2, which differ in length of linkers separating anion binding motifs from the fullerene surface, are capable of strong and more selective binding of halide anions than their non-fullerene analogue. This is achieved by the preorganization of binding units, solvent shielding, and $\\pi -$ hole assistance provided by the bulky and highly polarizable $C_{60}$ architecture. Remarkable halide anion binding enhancements can be achieved by the complexation of a potassium cation by the rigid crown ether moiety located close to the fullerene surface. Notably, potassium binding by receptors 1 and 2 results in strong augmented iodide binding selectivity, with association constants matching the value of the non-fullerene heteroditopic receptor analogue which is capable of anion binding assisted by the close contact with the crown ether cobound potassium cation.\nFullerene spatial separation of XB donors and the crown ether complexed $K^{+}$ resulted in a rare example of an artificial receptor containing two anion binding sites with opposing preferences for hard and soft halides. Detailed analysis $of^{1}H$ NMR titration data allowed for deconvolution of the ion-pair binding modes contributing to the overall 1:1 stoichiometric halide anion binding by $1 \\cdot K^{+}$ and $2 \\cdot K^{+}.$ Soft polarizable iodide was bound almost exclusively (>90$\\%$) by the tetradentate XB binding domain in proximity to the fullerene surface. This binding mode also dominated in the case of smaller and harder chloride (ca. 60$\\%$); however, a significant portion of chloride(ca.40$\\%$)was associated in a close contact ion-pair with the crown ether bound potassium cation without assistance of the XB binding domains.\n27376\nArticle\nAltogether, the presented results demonstrate the unprecedented potential of fullerene surfaces in anion recognition host-guest chemistry. Importantly, polarizing the $C_{60}$ surface via proximal cation recognition can elicit particularly strong interactions with polarizable soft anion species such as iodide and transfer electrostatic effects over significant distances. Modulating the properties of fullerene-based compounds via reversible noncovalent charged guest recognition may find future applications in molecular sensors, solar cell devices, and photodynamic therapy.\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nsi Supporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c07774.\nExperimental procedures and methods, NMR spectra, titration data, additional data, and figures (PDF)\nAccession Codes\nCCDC 2282543 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

I don't need any explanations, just output the answer according to the format. The input content is as follows: GLYCOSYLATION\nmade compounds (Fig. 1A) (29). Introdu carbohydrate moieties into phenols has prL to be an effective approach for modifying their physical and biological properties in drug discovery endeavors. Glycosylation of phenols (3) is complicated as they exhibit modest nucleophilicity compared with alcohols under acidic conditions (1 to 2; Fig. IB). Moreover, phenols are ambident nucleophiles, potentially resulting in either O-glycosylated (4) or C-glycosylated products (5).\nPd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions(Fig. 1C, left cycle) are usually initiated by Pd(0)-mediated OA (6 to 7), followed by ligand exchange (7 to 8) and reductive elimination(8 to 9) to give the desired products (here Oarylated phenols 9). Recognizing the limitation of this cycle in activating/building $Csp^{3}$ centers (30), we designed a strategy (Fig. iC, right cycle) that uses bench-stable, orthoiodobiphenyl-substituted sulfides (31,32) 11 as glycosyl donors. The aryl iodide unit in 11 readily undergoes oxidative addition with Pd(0) catalysts, forming an OA complex 12 that acts as an effective glycosyl ( $Csp^{3})$ electrophile, likely driven by its tendency to undergo $Csp^{2}-S$ reductive elimination (indicated by dashed lines). Nucleophilic attack to 12 by phenoxides 10 proceeds through a clean and general $S_{N}2$ mechanism, resulting in inversion of the glycosyl center and generation of 13.\nAs a result of the donor activation mechanism, this glycosylation method exhibits a notable tolerance toward functional groups and allows using unprotected glycosyl donors. No O-arylation side products are observed from the process (Fig. 1C), indicating that our approach directs the Pd-containing OA complex(such as 12) to transition from an arylating agent ( $Csp^{2})$ to a glycosylating agent ( $Csp^{3})$ , unveiling an unprecedented reactivity. The OA complex 12 behaves uniformly as an $S_{N}2$ electrophile, from fully oxygenated to fully deoxygenated donors, a rarity in carbohydrate chemistry. This method grants access to either isomer of the phenolic O-glycoside products in a predictable manner, many of which were previously challenging to obtain. The transformation occurs under mildly basic conditions and can be performed as easily as a Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction.\nReaction validation and condition optimization Our study commenced with the model reaction between sulfide 14 or 15 and 4-methoxy phenol(16) to make O-glycoside 17 or 18 (Fig. 2). The stereoselective synthesis of 2-deoxyglycosides of phenols (e.g,,17/18) has been difficult due to the lack of a C2-substituent as a stereodirecting auxiliary and the susceptibility of the 2-deoxyglycoside products to acid-promoted hydrolysis. Guided by the reaction design in Fig. 1C, we established conditions to make\nPalladium catalysis enables cross-coupling-like $S_{N}2-$ glycosylation of phenols\nLi-Fan Deng1+, Yingwei Wang2+, Shiyang Xu1, Ao $Shen^{1},$ Hangping Zhu1, Siyu Zhang,\nXia Zhang1, Dawen Niu1*\nDespite their importance in life and material sciences, the efficient construction of stereo-defined glycosides remains a challenge. Studies of carbohydrate functions would be advanced if glycosylation methods were as reliable and modular as palladium (Pd)-catalyzed cross-coupling. However, Pd-catalysis excels in forming $sp^{2}-$ hybridized carbon centers whereas glycosylation mostly builds $sp^{3}-$ hybridized C-O linkages. We report a glycosylation platform through Pd-catalyzed SN2 displacement from phenols toward bench-stable, ary|-iodide-containing glycosyl suffides. The key Pd(II) oxidative addition intermediate diverges from an arylating agent ( $Csp^{2}$ electrophile) to a glycosylating agent ( $Csp^{3}$ electrophile). This method inherits many merits of cross-coupling reactions, including operational simplicity and functional group tolerance. It preserves the $S_{N}2$ mechanism for various substrates and is amenable to late-stage glycosylation of commercial drugs and natural products.\nhe utility of glycosides in medicinal chemistry, materials, and biological science is well appreciated (1,2) but difficulties in their synthesis by glycosylation pose substantial obstacles to exploring their functions. Both reactants in glycosylationthe glycosyl donors and acceptors-are often structurally complex, and the properties of products are profoundly affected by the absolute configuration of glycosidic centers. Therefore, an ideal glycosylation method needs to simultaneously address chemo- and stereoselectivity issues, two persistent challenges in synthesis.\nGlycoside synthesis has been propelled by the introduction of new donors and their activating approaches. Most reported glycosylation methods proceed under (Lewis) acid-promoted conditions, which convert glycosyl donors to(equivalents of) oxocarbenium ions for subsequent trapping by acceptors (3, 4). These techniques have been the comerstones in carbohydrate synthesis and have allowed for preparation of complex structures (5-8). However, controlling or predicting stereoselectivity remains nontrivial as the glycosylation mechanism often shifts within the $S_{N}1/S_{N}2$ continuum (9). depending on the properties of reactants and reaction parameters (I0). Issues can also arise when labile donors or harsh activating conditions are needed, complicating reaction setup. Among the venues to overcome these obstacles, developments include the Yu group (II). which exploits selective gold-alkyne interactions; the Jacobsen group (12, 13), which explores mild hydrogen-bond catalysis; the Miller group (14,15), which hamesses the strong Ca-F bond-forming energy; the Nguyen group (16) that employs Lewis base catalysis; and the Cod'ee (17), Takemoto (18), and Loh groups (19), which utilize halogen-bond catalysis, and others based on transition metal catalysis (20,21). We have reported radical activation of glycosyl donors (22). Despite this progress, there is still a high demand for methods with a general scope to prepare stereodefined glycosides in a simple and predictable manner, which continues to fuel mechanistic and methodological advancements.\nThe modularity and reliability inherent in Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have made them indispensable tools in organic synthesis (23,24). If O-glycosylation could be as straightforward and robust as Pd-catalyzed cross coupling, the downstream exploration of glycosides would be greatly facilitated. However, Pd-catalysis is typically effective in activating and forging $sp^{2}-$ hybridized carbon centers, whereas glycosidic bonds are mostly $sp^{3}-$ hybridized C-O linkages. Strategies that can bridge this gap and channel the power of Pd-catalyzed cross coupling into the field of glycoside synthesis hold considerable potential. O'Doherty and others have applied Pd-catalyzed allylic substitution, followed by alkene (di)hydroxylation, for the de novo synthesis of O-glycosides (25,26). Here, we report a Pd-catalyzed $S_{N}2$ glycosylation method that commences with the oxidative addition (OA). The utility of this approach is showcased in a general and simple $S_{N}2$ glycosylation of phenols, a prominent challenge in O-glycoside synthesis.\nReaction design\nGeneral and straightforward methods for synthesizing stereodefined phenolic O-glycosides are highly valuable but remain nontrivial(14,27,28). Phenols-glycosylated or not-are abundant in both naturally occurring and man-\n1 of 8\nR=Me, Scrophuloside C R=OH, Scrophuloside D\nGlycosylated Genistein\nAfeletecan (Phase I, anticancer)\nO-glycosides 17/18 from 14/15 in high yields, with dibenzothiophene (19) formed as a byproduct. The $\\beta -O-$ glycoside 17 was obtained from the $\\alpha -S-$ glycoside 14, and a-O-glycoside 18 formed if $\\beta -S-$ glycoside 15 was employed. The clean inversion of the glycosidic centers in 14/15 suggests that this Pd-catalyzed glycosylation proceeds by means of an $S_{N}2-$ type mechanism. General and operationally simple $S_{N}2-$ glycosylation methods remain rare, despite their high value as tools (12, 34-36) to access stereodefined glycosides. Even scarcer are methods that can afford both stereoisomers, as accessing the corresponding donors with defined and stable configurations is not always simple. In our case, sulfide donors (with general structure Il) could be prepared from the corresponding 1-glycosy thioacetates in one pot at decagram scales (see SM section 3) and stored for months without precautions to avoid air or moisture. Employing the Pd(0)-mediated OA as a donor-activating\n2 of 8\nLigands\nByproduct\napproach, this method provides either isomer of the phenolic O-glycosides. The reaction proceeds at $60 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ and only requires $K_{2}CO_{3}$ as base and a catalytic amount (2 mol$\\%$) of Pd(0) catalyst assembled from Pd(dba) $_{2}$ and Xantphos.\nWe conducted control experiments to identify factors influencing the performance of this method. Little reaction occurred in the absence of Pd(0) catalyst (entry 2) or a suitable base(entry 3). Inorganic bases $K_{2}CO_{3}($ entry 1) and $Cs_{2}CO_{3}($ entry 4) exhibited better effects than organic bases such as $Et_{3}N$ (entry 5) and TMG(entry 6). A saturated aqueous solution of $K_{2}CO_{3}$ could be used (entry 7), suggesting that the reaction has a good tolerance to water. When the reaction is conducted at room temperature(roughly $25^{\\circ}C),$ the conversion is relatively low within the same time period (entry 8). The use of more polar solvents such as MeCN greatly eroded the stereochemical purity of products(entry 9). The added ligands exert pronounced effects on the reaction efficiency (entries 10 to 13), likely through modulating the properties of OA complex such as 12 in Fig. IC. Unlike phosphine-based ligands, nitrogen-based ligands and N-heterocyclic carbene ligands we tried were less effective (see SM, section 4). Addition of a stoichiometric amount of TEMPO was fully tolerated, essentially excluding a radical-based mechanism (entry 14) (22,37).\nSubstrate scope\nIt is rare for a glycosylation method to hold high efficiency for a broad array of substrates as the reaction mechanism (and outcome) often varies with the reactivities of donors and acceptors (38-41). Our method accommodates diverse glycosyl units (Fig. 3), providing either of the two possible stereoisomers with high purities (22a-m). For example, donors bearing benzyl (22a, 22k, 22l), acetyl (22b, 22f), benzylidene (22d) and silyl-protecting groups(22c,22e) could all be used. Various other 2-deoxypyranosyl groups (22f-j) were installed with similar efficiiencies. Our method could be adopted to construct the more electron-rich furanosyl linkages: both isomers of 2-deoxyribosides were generated cleanly (22k). This method is not limited to 2-deoxy sugars, and the $S_{N}2$ mechanism operates with fully oxygenated (22l and 38g/h in Fig. 4) and fully deoxygenated tetrahydropyranyl (22m) donors. 2-O-acetyl or 2-N-acetyl protected donors were unsuccessful, likely because of interference from these neighboring participating groups (fig. S6). Aliphatic alcohols are almost inert under the current conditions, allowing the use of unprotected glycosyl donors, as shown by examples 22g-j. The results attest to the exceptional functional group tolerance of this OA-initiated glycosylation method. It is worth highlighting that many of the glycosyl units in Fig. 3 are deoxygenated and electron rich. To obtain the corresponding O-glycosides with high stereochemical purities would be tedious by conventional methods, due to dearth of suitable donors, lack of stereo-directing auxiliaries, and susceptibility of products to acidpromoted hydrolysis.\nBoth electron-rich (22w, 22ae, 22ah) and electron-deficient phenols (22n-r) were accommodated, with no product arising from C-glycosylation observed. Phenols bearing an ortho-substituent were competent substrates(22u-w, 22y-z). Functional groups such as aldehydes (22q), esters (22r), secondary amides(22af), nitriles (22p), and ketones (22x) were tolerated. The terminal alkene group in 22v did not isomerize to conjugate with a phenyl ring.\n3 of 8\nPotentially chelating heterocycles including dioxolanes (22t), thiazoles (22aa), quinolines(22ab), pyridines (22ac), oxazoles (22ad), and morpholines (22ae) were incorporated. Protic hydrogen atoms in secondary amides (22af) were compatible. Tyrosine derivatives could be glycosylated (22af), and the a-stereocenter in the amino acid backbone stayed intact. Aryl bromides/chlorides(22n,22u,22y-z)did not interfere with this method, likely because the oxidative addition to aryl iodide units in donor 14 or 15 is a faster process. The remaining aryl halide groups could serve as handles for further derivatizations (see below). Particularly noteworthy is that aryl boronic esters(22s) survived the reaction conditions without undergoing a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, highlighting the distinctive reactivity of our\n4 of 8\nFig. 4. Synthetic application. (A) Glycosylation of natural products and commercial drugs. (B) One-pot, multistep, multicomponent reactions. Reactions in this table were performed at 0.1 or 0.2 mmol scale in toluene (0.1 M) for 24 hours, using Pd( $PPh_{3})_{4}(2$ mol$\\%$), Xantphos (4 mol$\\%$), and $CS_{2}CO_{3}.$ lsolated yields are reported. Diastereomeric ratios were determined by NMR analysiss $ak_{2}CO_{3}$ used as base; $^{b}$ Reaction performed at $100 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} .$ See SM sections 6 and 7 for experimental details.\nPd(II) OA complexes (i.e., 12 in Fig. 1C) as glycosyl ( $Csp^{3})$ electrophiles.\nSynthetic application\nTo demonstrate the utility of this method, we applied it in the modification of natural products and commercial drugs (Fig. 4A). Simple phenols such as vanillin (25) and triclosan (34) were glycosylated smoothly. Internal alkene groups are accommodated, as exemplified by the formation of 30-31 and 35. The tertiary amine groups in drug molecules may interfere with acid-promoted glycosylation methods, but show excellent compatibility with our conditions (26-27, 33). Under our conditions, protection of aliphatic alcohols is unnecessary(29, 33). In the case of chrysin (23), the C7OH is glycosylated with high regioselectivity.\n5 of 8\nA\nFor polyphenols such as icaritin (37), two glycosyl units can be installed at a time, both with high selectivities. Glycosylated anthraquinones are ubiquitous in nature and we show that 2-hydroxylanthraquinone is a competent substrate in our reaction (24). O-glycosylated coumarins are frequently employed as fluorescent probes for detection of glycosidases (42), and coumarins are glycosylated cleanly (32). Steriodal phenols such as estrone (28) and estradiol(29) are modified. A glycosyl unit was installed onto ezetimibe (36), a cholesterol absorption inhibitor containing a sensitive $\\beta -$ lactam unit SN-38 is a potent anticancer agent derived from camptothecin (43) but is poorly soluble in water. Conjugation with a sugar may improve the pharmacological profile of the parent molecule; see Afeletecan in Fig. 1A. We mounted an array of glycosyl units, induding both C2-deoxygenated(38a-f) and C2-oxygenated sugars (38g-h), onto an SN-38 derivative (Fig. 4A).\nPd-catalyzed $S_{N2}$ glycosylation could be performed in tandem with other Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, affording carbohydratecontaining compounds by one-pot, multistep processes in which a single Pd(0)-complex catalyzes two distinct steps (Fig. 4B). Mixing glycosyl donor 14 or 15,m-bromo phenol (39), and aryl boronic ester in one pot with a Pd(0)catalyst and a base, the Pd-catalyzed glycosylation and the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling proceed in sequence, to give loratadine derivative 41 or L-tyrosine derivative 40 in useful overall yields. The glycosylation could also be merged with Buchwald-Hartwig (44, 45) coupling if the ligand is switched to Brettphos (46) and m-toluamide as the third coupling partner; consecutive formation of $Csp^{3}-O$ and $Csp^{2}-N$ bonds delivered 42 smoothly. Lastly, a sequence composed of glycosylation/Sonogashira coupling provides ethisterone-sugar conjugate 43 in 61$\\%$ overall yield. These examples illustrate selectivity of our Pd-catalyzed glycosylation and suggest a rapid approach to make glycoconjugates.\nMechanistic studies\nAcetyl-protected sulfide donor 44 reacted with Pd( $PPh_{3})_{4}$ smoothly, and the OA complex 4.5 could be isolated from the mixture by column chromatography (Fig. 5A). The facility of the OA step may be attributable to the sulfur atom in 44, which could pre-coordinate with Pd(0). Complex 45 is a crystalline solid and its mo lecular structure was verified by x-ray crystallography. Similar to other classical Pd(II) OA complexes (47), the Pd center in 45 adopts a(slightly twisted) square planar configuration, with the two neutral ligands (ie,, sulfur and phosphine atoms) occupying para positions. From the solid-state structure of 45, we noted that the C1-S bond is slightly elongated (1.83 to 1.87 A) and the C1-O bond is shortened (1.41 to 1.39 A) from their normal lengths (48), indicating buildup of a positive charge at the CI position.\nTreating 45 with 4-methoxy phenol (16) in the presence of $K_{2}CO_{3}$ afforded 22b with decent efficiency and inverted configuration. Addition of extemal ligand Xantphos gave similar results. A small amount of 45(2mol$\\%$)could catalyze the reaction between 44 and 16 to form 22b. These results support 45 as a reactive intermediate in our process.\nWe next performed DFT calculations (B3LYPD3/def2-tzvp/SMD(toluene)//B3LYP-D3/def2-svp) employing 45 and phenoxide 46 (or cesium phenoxide, see SM section 9) as model substrates (Fig.5B). Two potential pathways were examined: In principle, reductive elimination of C-S bond in 45 to yield sulfonium Int-I (by means of TS-I), followed by phenoxide attack from 46 could afford glycoside 47. Alternatively, direct attack of phenoxide 46 toward 4.5 by means of TS-II, followed by reductive elimination of the C-S bond (45) in Int-II would provide 47 as well, affording 19 as a byproduct and regenerating Pd(0) catalyst. Upon comparing the free energies of species TS-I and TS-II (note: with different charge states), we observed that the pathway through TS-II exhibits lower barriers. Presumably, coordination of the sulfur atom to the Pd center polarized the C-S bond in 45 and made it electrophilic enough toward phenoxide attack. We also considered a scenario where the iodine anion dissociates early from 45 before $S_{N2}$ displacement by 46 (see SM, section 9).\nWe also compared the relative reactivities of various phenols bearing different parasubstituents (48) in our glycosylation reaction(Fig.5C). In internal competition experiments, those with electron-withdrawing substituents(49) react at faster rates, presumably because they are more easily deprotonated under basic conditions. By external competition experiments, we found that the turnover frequency, as inferred from the conversion of 15, increases with the electron-withdrawing ability of the para-substituent. The absence of phenol 48 resulted in essentially no reaction. These results indicate the involvement of phenoxide nucleophiles in the turnover-determining step and in turn lend some further support for the pathway through TS-II. Although additional experiments are warranted to elucidate mechanistic details, the ability of Pd-containing OA complex to serve as a glycosyl ( $Csp^{3})$ electrophile was quite general (see examples in Figs. 3 and 4).\nConclusions\nWe developed a strategy that exploits Pd(0)mediated oxidative addition-the initial step in classical cross-coupling reactions-as a tool to activate glycosyl donors. The key to this success was the use of aryl iodide-containing glycosyl sulfides as donors, which upon reaction with Pd(0)-catalysts furnished Pd(II)containing OA complexes that act as glycosyl( $Csp^{3})$ electrophiles. The following glycosidic bond-forming stage caused clean inversion of the glycosyl centers in donors, and either stereoisomer could be obtained in a predictable manner. This approach enabled a general method for $S_{N}2-$ glycosylation of phenols, allowing for the synthesis of phenolic O-glycosides that were previously challenging to access.\nThe mechanism grants this reaction operational simplicity and functional group tolerance. No acid or cryogenic conditions are required, and the reaction can be set up similarly to other Pd-catalyzed C-O cross-coupling reactions. Moreover, the method is amenable to late-stage glycosylation of a wide range of commercial drugs and natural products. The generality and mildness of the method is further showcased in several one-pot, multistep, multicomponent reactions. We anticipate that this study will bring opportunities in Pd-mediated glycosylation reactions, enabling advancements in carbohydrate synthesis and its application in various fields.\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n1.A.Varkietal,Essentials of Glycobillogy (Cold Spring Harbor, 2022).ed.4\n2.J.J.Barchi,Comprehensive Glycoscience: From Chemistry to Systems Biology (Elsevier,2021),ed.2\n3.A.V.

The mechanistic studies confirmed that the reaction proceeds by adding a difluoroalkyl radical to acrylamide, followed by unexpected intramolecular 1,4-hydrogen atom transfer(HAT) and SET oxidation reaction . DFT calculations demonstrate that the destabilizing steric repulsion is the key factor controlling the chemoselectivity, which switches from 1,4-HAT to 5-exo spirocyclization. This work provides an important basis for the 1, 4-HAT reaction in theoretical and practical synthesis applications. \\space $R^{2}$ \\space $R^{3}$ \\space CuCl, BrCF2CO2Et \\space $\\overset{R^{2}}{H}$ \\space Ar \\space H \\space Bipy, $Pin_{2}B_{2},K_{2}CO_{3}$ \\space $CO_{2}Et$ \\space $\\xrightarrow{| \\cdot CF_{2}CO_{2}Et}|$ \\space $|R^{2}_{N}\\overset{O}{\\xrightarrow{O}}\\cdot R^{3}\\xrightarrow{1,4+HAT}B ecause of the wide application of fluorinated compounds \n in pharmaceutical, agricultural, and functional materials, \n selective introduction of fluorinated groups into parent molecules has become a conventional strategy to significantly improve chemical and metabolic stability, lipophilicity, and biological activity. $^{1}$ The difluoromethylene group ( $CF_{2})$ has been identified as a metabolic biologically stable bioisostere of weak hydrogen-bond donors such as alcohols, anilines, amines, and thiophenols. $^{2}$ In the past decades, transition-metalcatalyzed/mediated difluoroalkylation on an unsaturated carbon atom has been widely used to construct difluorinated compounds in synthetic organic chemistry. $^{3}$ In particular, hydrodifluoromethylation has been the most straightforward and efficient method to forge a C( $sp^{3})-CF_{2}G$ bond due to its high regioselectivity and atom economy. $^{4}$ From a mechanistic point of view, external H atom donors such as hydrosilane, tin hydrides, borohydrides, and Hantzsch ester are generally required to insert a H atom onto the resulting carbon radical intermediate to complete the alkene hydrofunctionalization(Scheme 1a). To overcome this defect associated with the intermolecular H atom delivery step, the hydrofunctionalization of alkenes through the precise intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has attracted extensive attention. $^{5}$ Liu, Tan, and co-workers have developed elegant strategies for remote aliphatic C-H functionalization through 1,n-HAT tandem process. $^{6}$ In 2018, Nevado group reported visible-lightinduced 1,6-difunctionalizations of alkenes with $BrCF_{2}CO_{2}Et$ through the olefin difluoroalkylation, intramolecular 1,5-HAT, and remote trapped reaction of C-centered radicals with O-or C-nucleophiles (Scheme 1b).

The group of Ma and Li demonstrated visible-light-mediated cascade reactions to synthesize difluoroalkylated ketones via 1,5-HAT and Kornblum reaction (Scheme $1d).^{9}$ \n Inspired by these seminal works, we wondered whether hydrodifluoromethylation of electron-deficient alkenes could also be achieved via an intramolecular 1,4-HAT which is triggered by selective addition of difluoroalkyl radical to the $\\beta -$ position of acrylamide. This will be a mild and convenient approach to obtain these difluoroalkylated compounds, which can serve as versatile synthons in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials chemistry (Scheme $1e).^{10}$ However, to achieve this aim, several challenges still exist: (i) In most cases, for enthalpic and entropic reasons, 1,5-HAT is the more predominant pathway than 1,4-HAT due to more favorable sixmembered transition state for the former. $^{5a,b,11}$ Indeed,1,4HAT is seldom used to synthesize useful molecules. $^{12}$ (ii) Using N-benzylacrylamides as substrates, the dearomatization of p-methoxyaryl ring through radical spirocyclization to obtain compound 4 has been mainly reported. $^{13}$ Thus, how to regulate the selectivity of intermediates I (intramolecular 1,4HAT versus 5-exo spirocyclization) is key for our new strategy.(iii) Meanwhile, several competitive side reactions such as radical atom-transfer processes to afford hydrodifluoroalkyla- $tion^{4}$ product 6 or $\\beta -$ hydrogen elimination reaction compound $5^{14}$ should be also avoided. Herein we report a Cu-catalyzed hydrodifluoroalkylation of acrylamides via radical addition to $\\beta -$ position of acrylamide, followed by precise intramolecular 1,4-HAT using a benzyl group as a traceless redox-active hydrogen donor. \n Optimization of the reaction was explored using Nbenzylacrylamide 1a as the model substrate and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate( $BrCF_{2}CO_{2}$ Et,2a)asagem-difluoromethylene ( $CF_{2})$ group precursor (Table 1). Surprisingly, treatment of la with CuBr(20mol$\\%$),2,2'-bipyridine (Bipy)(30mol$\\%$), $Pin_{2}B_{2}(30$ mol$\\%$), $andK_{2}CO_{3}(1.5$ equiv)in1,2dichloroethane (DCE) at $85 \\space ^{\\circ}C$ gave the 1,4-HAT product 3a in 87$\\%$ yield (based $on^{19}F \\space\\text{NM}\\widetilde{R})$ with only a 5$\\%$ yield of the spiro[4.5]decane 4a, a dearomatization product (Table 1, entry 1). Encouraged by this result, we further optimized this reaction with CuI as the catalyst, and the yield of the main product 3a was reduced to 52$\\%$ with a 10$\\%$ yield of 4a (entry 2). CuCN gave 3a only in 13$\\%$ yield, but 4a was not detectable(entry 6). CuOTf and Cu(OAC) $_{2}$ afforded 3a in 95$\\%$ and 93$\\%$yield, respectively (entries 4 and 5). To our delight, with CuCI as the catalyst, the 1,4-HAT reaction occurred exclusively, thus leading to the regioselective product 3a in a nearly quantitative yield (entry 3). After examining the solvent effects, we found that the use of acetonitrile or dioxane afforded the desired hydrodifluoroalkylation product 3a in 92$\\%$ or 94$\\%$ yield, respectively (entries 7 and 8). However, other solvents (e.g., toluene, EtOH, and EA) attenuated the yield (entries 9-11). A nearly 84$\\%$ yield of 3a could be obtained in the absence of $Pin_{2}B_{2},$ with only 5$\\%$ yield of 4a being observed. Control experiments showed that the copper catalyst, the Bipy ligand, and $K_{2}CO_{3}$ are essential for the reaction (Table 1, entries 1315). \n After the optimized reaction condition had been established, we examined various benzyl groups as hydrogen donors (Table 2, see the Supporting Information ).

However, when the benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl, 4-(benzyloxy)phenyl, and 4acetoxybenzyl were used, the 1,4-HAT compound 3b was obtained in good to excellent yields but with no detectable 4b, in contrast to previous reports. $^{13}$ The substrates with either an electron-donating (Me, ph) or electron-withdrawing group (F, Cl,Br, $CF_{3}$ , $CF_{3}O$ ,CN)onthebenzylalsounderwentthis reaction smoothly. It was worth noting that the electronwithdrawing nitro group on the benzyl gave an unsatisfactory result with only 14$\\%$ yield of the 1,4-HAT compound 3b. \n Then we investigated the substrate scope on the Nsubstituent $(R^{2})$ of N-benzylacrylamides (Scheme 2). Substrates with linear alkane substituent (methyl, n-butyl, dodecyl, or octadecyl), branched alkane substituent (isopropyl or tertbutyl), cycloalkane substituent (cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, or cyclohexyl), or even a 1-adamantanyl substituent consistently afforded the corresponding 1,4-HAT compounds 3a-3l in excellent yields. The substrates with the bulky substitutions (e.g,, 1f, 1g, and 1j) resulted in the quantitative generation of 3f, 3g, and 3j. Since the incorporation of fluorine atom(s) into the amino acids or peptides can result in unexpected beneficial effects, the present reaction may provide new routes for synthesis of peptide-based bioactive molecules. $^{16}$ The substrates with the methyl ester of glycine (1m), the methyl ester of 2-amino-2-methylpropanoic acid (1n), methyl 3-aminopropanoate (1o), and methyl 4-aminobutanoate (1p) were also examined under the standard reaction condition. As expected, the desired 2,2-difluoropentanedia- \n 2890 \n Scheme 2. Substrate Scope of CuCl-Catalyzed Cascade Reaction \n mides 3m-3p were obtained in excellent yields. When the substituents were chiral natural amino acids, the corresponding 2,2-difluoropentanediamides 3q-3s were obtained in good yields (63$\\%$, 88$\\%$, and 87$\\%$, respectively) and with a mixture of diastereoisomers in an approximately 1:1 ratio. Next, a variety of acrylamides were investigated. Acrylamides with alkyl and aryl substituents at the $\\alpha -$ position of acrylamide were suitable substrates, affording the corresponding 1,4-HAT products 3t3z in good yields. For example, the substrates 1t-1w with alkyl substituents (n-butyl, isopropyl, cyclopentyl, and ethoxymethyl) were efficiently transformed into the corresponding 2,2difluoropentanediamides in 99$\\%$ yield. The substrates with aryl substituents (phenyl, p-chlorophenyl, and p-methylphenyl)(1x-1z) afforded the expected products (3x-3z) in 52-85$\\%$yield. Moreover, the unactivated olefin was also viable for the reaction, thus generating 5-amino-2,2-difluoropentanamide 3aa in 73$\\%$ yield. However, using the substrates with the monosubstituted olefin $(R^{2}=H),$ unexpectedly, the desired 1,4-HAT compounds 3ab and 3ac were not obtained, while the difluoroalkylated 2-azaspiro[4.5]decanes 4ab and 4ac were obtained in 90$\\%$ and 85$\\%$ yield, respectively. This result implies that the $\\alpha -$ substituent of the acrylamide is crucial for the regioselectivity of the free radical reaction. Clearly, the substrates with large steric hindrance are favorable for the free radical 1,4-HAT reaction, while the free radical 5-exo spirocyclization reaction is dominant for the substrates with small steric hindrance. Finally, a variety of difluoroalkyl bromides were examined. Delightfully, other difluorinating reagents such as bromodifluoroacetamide and bromodifluoroketones were well-tolerated, providing the corresponding products (3ad-3ak) in moderate to excellent yields (6499$\\%$). More importantly, this methodology is feasible for functionalization of bioactive molecules, including mexiletine, dehydroabietylamine, and amlodipine, which produced 3al3an in 59-99$\\%$ yield. \n Mechanistic studies were also performed (Scheme 3). When the well-established radical traps TEMPO and BHT were used, \n the desired 1,4-HAT reaction was partially or completely inhibited. This implies the involvement of the radical intermediate in this reaction (see the SI). The 1,4-HAT reaction was confirmed by using the deuterated substrate[D2]-1a, which afforded the corresponding monodeuterated compound [D1]-3a in 40$\\%$ yield (>98$\\%$ deuteration) and dearomatization product [D1]-4a in 40$\\%$ yield (Scheme 3a).A crossover experiment was also performed using a 1:1 mixture of [D2]-1a and 1l, and H/D scrambling between [D2]-1a and 1l was not observed (Scheme 3b). Furthermore, the kinetic isotope effect was also examined using [D1]-1a, and a $k_{H}/k_{D}$ of 6.7 was observed (Scheme 3c), indicating that the activation of the C-H bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom should be a kinetically relevant process in this tandem reaction.17 \n To gain insights into the origin of this intriguing chemoselectivity, namely, 1,4-HAT vs 5-exo spirocyclization, we turned to dispersion-corrected density functional theory(DFT) calculations (see the SI). Computed Gibbs free energy profiles for 1,4-HAT and 5-exo spirocyclization for two model substrates are given in Scheme 4. The results show that for the in situ-generated radical intermediate I-Me, 1,4-HAT via TS1a-Me is preferred over 5-exo spirocyclization via TS-1b-Me by 2.0 kcal/mol, while the 5-exo spirocyclization is favored over 1,4-HAT after replacement of the methyl group in I-Me by hydrogen (TS-1a-H vs TS-1b-H). This is well-consistent with \n 2891 \n Scheme 4. Computed Free Energy Profiles of the Competing 1,4-HAT and 5-exo Spirocyclization Processes at the B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVPP-SMD(Dichloroethane)//B3LYP-D3/def2-SVP-SMD(Dichloroethane) Level of Theory \n our experimental observations. Examination of the structures of transition states reveals that the 5-exo spirocyclization transition state TS-1b-Me suffers from destabilizing steric repulsion between the methyl group and the benzyl hydrogen(Scheme 4a). Such repulsion could be avoided in 1,4-HAT transition state TS-1a-Me. This nicely explains why the 5-exo spirocyclization becomes the major pathway after replacing the methyl group in I-Me with hydrogen. Thus, the destabilizing steric repulsion caused by the methyl group should be the key factor in determining the chemoselectivity switching from 1,4HAT to 5-exo spirocyclization. \n In light of the control experiments and previous work, plausible mechanism is proposed (Scheme 5). The catalytic process is initiated by a single-electron reduction of $BrCF_{2}CO_{2}$ Et 2a by the complex of Cu $(I)/B_{2}Pin_{2}$ to generate $CF_{2}$ COOEt radical. The $CF_{2}$ COOEt radical then attacks the terminal carbon of acrylamide 1 to generate the carbon radical intermediate I. Then there are two plausible pathways for the further cascade reaction. In path a, when $R^{3} \n eq H,$ asubsequent precise intramolecular 1,4-hydrogen atom transfer leads to the formation of a benzyl radical II, which is then oxidized by the Cu(II) species to produce the carbocation III while maintaining the redox catalytic turnover with regeneration of the active Cu(I) species. Then the 2,2-difluoropentanamide is obtained through hydrolysis reaction in the post-treatment. In path b, when $R^{3}=H,$ the radical II undergoes 5-exo cyclization onto the phenol ring to give the spiro intermediate IV, which is \n LCu(I)-Bpin \n - $BrCF_{2}G$ \n LCu(II)-Bpin \n $R^{3}H$ \n $R^{2}$ \n 之 \n Path a \n R2 \n i-H \n $\\xrightarrow{LCu(II)-Bpin}$ \n $R^{2}.N^{+}$ \n $\\xrightarrow{\\text{hydrolysis}}$ \n R1 \n LCu(I)-Bpin \n R1$R^{2}$ \n $R^{2}$ \n $R^{2}$ \n 2G LCu(II)-Bpin \n MeBr \n LCu(I)-Bpin \n $_{We}^{Y_{Me}}$ \n $\\overset{+OMe}{V}$ \n oxidized by Cu(II) to oxonium ion V, followed by the loss of Me to access the ultimate spiro product 4. \n In summary, we have developed a Cu-catalyzed hydrodifluoroalkylation of benzyl-protected acrylamides which results in difluoropentanedioate via in situ deprotection of the benzyl protecting group under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations have confirmed that this reaction involves the rarely occurring intramolecular 1,4hydrogen atom transfer process. This study provides an important basis for the 1,4-HAT reaction in theoretical and practical synthesis applications and would be useful to synthesize important fluorinated intermediates or bioactive compounds. \n ASSOCIATED CONTENT \n Data Availability Statement \n The data underlying this study are available in the published article and its Supporting Information. \n Supporting Information \n The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.3c00860. \n Experimental details and procedures, characterization and crystallographic data, computational details, and spectra of all unknown compounds (PDF) \n Accession Codes \n CCDC 2234040 (3g) contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

This is done by performing closed-loop optimization of regioselective benzoylation of unprotected glycosides using Bayesian optimization. Both 6-O-monobenzoylations and 3,6-O-dibenzoylations of three different monosaccharides are optimized. A novel transfer learning approach, where data from previous optimizations of different substrates is used to speed up the optimizations, has also been developed. The optimal conditions found by the Bayesian optimization algorithm provide new insight into substrate specificity, as the conditions found are significantly different. In most cases, the optimal conditions include $Et_{3}N$ and benzoic anhydride, a new reagent combination for these reactions, discovered by the algorithm, demonstrating the power of this concept to widen the chemical space. Further, the developed procedures include ambient conditions and short reaction times.\nIntroduction\nIn recent years Bayesian optimization has gained growing interest as a tool for reaction optimization, $^{1-7}$ and in some cases, it has been shown to be capable of outcompeting chemist intuition. $^{1,8}$ Further, Bayesian optimization can be combined with automated setups to obtain closed-loop systems. $^{2-7}$ Most of these closed-loop systems rely on a setup with a flow $cell^{2-4,9}$ and, recently, even closed-loop optimization of a multi-step synthesis using a flow reactor setup and Bayesian optimization has been described. $^{5}$ However, the flow setups are often limited to fast and homogeneous reactions. $^{10}$ The Hein group has, by utilizing a robotic platform, shown that closed-loop optimization of batch synthesis is also possible. $^{6}$ Investigating optimization of batch synthesis is of high interest, as it is a widespread approach throughout academia and industry, and it can easily be used directly in research and process optimization. Our focus is to combine Bayesian optimization with carbohydrate chemistry, since optimizing reactions with carbohydrates is notoriously tedious and labor-intensive. Hence, \"optimizing\" optimization of reactions involving carbohydrates is of interest. There are two major fields within oligosaccharide synthesis: glycosylation reactions and protective group chemistry. One of the major challenges in glycosylation reactions is controlling the anomeric diastereoselectivity, as the reaction often proceeds with a high degree of cationic character. A specific configuration of the anomeric center is however crucial for structural and hence biological properties and therefore this is a very active field of research. $^{14-18}$ Some guidelines for controlling the diastereoselectivity have been established, for instance, the use of \"solvent effects\" to favor different anomeric configurations, $^{19,20}$ though, these are ambiguous and might lead to advance assumptions, which could cause the chemist to not investigate certain conditions, that in fact might be the optimal ones. Protective groups can be used to guide the glycosylations toward a certain anomeric selectivity. Protecting carbohydrates is complicated by the presence of numerous hydroxyl groups, and regioselective procedures are necessary. The inherent complexity, exemplified above, makes it difficult to predict both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in reactions on carbohydrates. Reactions involving carbohydrates are further complicated by substrate specificity. Many elegant methods for obtaining regioselectivity and stereoselectivity have been established. $^{15,21,22}$ However, the regioselectivity/stereoselectivity is often a consequence of specific interactions with a promoter or catalyst, and the success of the methods is therefore very sensitive to changes in the carbohydrate substrate, which often deteriorates the selectivity or significantly decreases the yield. We want to investigate if Bayesian optimization can help overcome some of these issues. In this paper, we explore how closed-loop optimization and Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize\ncarbohydrate protective group chemistry, specifically regioselective benzoylations of unprotected glycosides.\nDifferent procedures for regioselective benzoylations have been described, though most rely on either coordination to a catalyst/ $promoter^{11,23-26}$ or regioselective formation of an acetal intermediate. $^{12,27,28}$ Non-trivial benzoylating reagents like benzoyl $cyanide^{13,29,30}$ and N- $benzoylimidazole^{31}$ have also been utilized to obtain regioselective in these reactions. In general, most of these procedures show high substrate specificity with the regioselectivity determined by the configuration of the hydroxyl groups relative to each other. The regioselectivity can for instance be determined by a preference for cis-vicinal diols, $^{16,32-34}$ apreference for diequatorial vicinal diols, $^{25}$ the axial oxy $effect^{30}$ the cyanide effect, $^{13,29}$ or dual hydrogen bonding. $^{35,36}$ Another aspect of the current methods is the necessity for more steps, complexations, and long reaction times at low temperatures in order to obtain acceptable selectivities. Some of the above-mentioned approaches are illustrated in Scheme 1. From the reactions in Scheme 1, it is seen that changing the carbohydrate substrate can change the selectivity, which exemplifies the substrate specificity. In theory, it should be possible to\n- Tin coordination by Onomura 2008 .\n10\n$\\begin{matrix}Me_{2}SnCl_{2}(0.05eq)\\\\ DIPEA(2.0eq.)\\\\ \\hline THF_{7}79 $\\%$ .2.5h \\end{matrix}This work 0 Base Benzoylating Reagent Product regioselectivity HO OHXPh No additional promoter or catalyst dreeentverteacility of teeayrerxagroty of develop regioselective benzoylation procedures that solely rely on the inherent differences in reactivity of the hydroxyl groups and some procedures using this approach for obtaining tribenzoylated glycosides in moderate yields (37-65$\\%$)have been described. $^{37,38}$ Though, the order of reactivity of the hydroxyl groups depends on the carbohydrate, , 37,39 and further, different studies of the reactivity of the hydroxyl groups observe different orders of reactivity, making the development of procedures solely relying on reactivity a tedious and non-trivial task (Fig. 1).\nThe lack of obvious optimal reaction conditions makes regioselective benzoylations an appropriate and challenging test case for investigating if, and how, Bayesian optimization can aid in developing new methods for protecting complex natural products like carbohydrates. Furthermore, for a method relying on reactivity rather than coordination etc. changing the carbohydrate substrate should not change the regioselectivity, unless changing the configuration of the carbohydrate leads to a change in relative reactivity. Although, changing the carbohydrate substrate might still lead to a change in the optimal reaction conditions. We, therefore, decided to include substrate specificity in our study, to both investigate how great an impact the substrate has on the optimal conditions, and also to investigate how substrate specificity can be taken into account in the most efficient way.\nResults and discussion\nDesign of closed-loop setup\nTo perform the closed-loop optimizations the setup shown in Fig. 2 was utilized. The setup consists of a computer with a Bayesian optimization algorithm (in the following referred to as the ReactionOptimizer), a ChemSpeed Flex robotic synthesis platform, and a UPLC. An introduction to theory behind Bayesian optimization is supplied in the ESI.* The robot is capable of fetching experiments proposed by the ReactionOptimizer through an SQL database. When an experiment has been carried out by the synthesis robot, an aliquot is transferred to the UPLC and the area under the peak from the desired compound is sent to the ReactionOptimizer. Using\na predefined scoring function, the ReactionOptimizer calculates a result using the area under the peak. From the result of the performed experiment and the results from all previous experiments, the ReactionOptimizer suggests a new experiment to be carried out by the robot. The Bayesian optimization algorithm used by the ReactionOptimizer is freely available on GitHub. $^{40}$ To get an understanding of the different hyperparameters of the optimization algorithm a benchmark study was carried out. The benchmark study can be found in ESI. $\\dagger$ An important hyperparameter is the xi-value, which describes how explorative the optimization algorithm is (see theory section in ESIt for details). To avoid the trade-off between exploration and exploitation we chose a dual approach where the algorithm starts by using a high xi-value, and after a predefined number of experiments switch to a low xi-value. The idea behind this approach is that the algorithm starts by being explorative and traversing many different areas of the high-dimensional surface, while still optimizing. Using the obtained information about the high-dimensional surface the algorithm carefully approaches the optimum when switching to the lower xi-value. The xi-changeover is predefined and determined before initializing the ReactionOptimizer. The changeover value was determined using the benchmark study and previous closedloop optimization. Instead of a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, the dual approach leads to a trade-off between time and improvement. Ideally, the xi-value should be switched from high to low when we are confident the global maximum is found, and after the switch, this maximum is explored using\na lower xi-value. However, time, i.e., budget, also has to be considered, and the xi-changeover has also been determined with an aim to have the total time of the optimization within a reasonable timeframe, and the total time of the optimization is defined by the total number of experiments. Closed-loops, where initial random experiments are included in the optimization, have been proposed using Latin hypercube sampling(LHS) $.^{41}$\nDesign of model reaction and reaction space\nTo test the setup, it was desirable to have a model reaction that is a real optimization problem, where the yield is zero in some of the reaction space and non-zero in other parts. The chosen model reaction is the regioselective benzoylation of the 6-OH of a $\\beta -$ glucoside (Fig. 2). The reaction time and temperature are set as constants, with a value of 1 hour and room temperature, respectively. This is done to both speed up the optimization, but also to make the final procedure fast and simple, so that the procedure will be useful for carbohydrate chemists if a highyielding procedure is found. Following the same reasoning, the reaction space is kept simple and only includes cheap and easily accessible reagents (Fig. 2A). In total 7 parameters are optimized simultaneously during the closed-loop, including equivalent benzoylating reagent, equivalent base, and concentration as continuous parameters. Discrete parameters are described as integers and include benzoylating reagent, base, and time between the addition of base and the addition of benzoylating reagent. Benzoyl chloride and benzoic anhydride were assigned the integers 1 and 2, respectively.\nHowever, for the base parameter, more than two bases were included in the reaction space, and a principal component analysis (PCA) was therefore performed to assign integers in a meaningful way, which we hypothesize would speed up the optimization, compared to assigning random integers. The PCA was performed using the descriptors shown with their origin in Table 1. The first plot in Fig. 2B shows the two first principal components. The loading plot shown in Fig. 2C illustrates how the different descriptors contribute to the principal components. It is seen that all descriptors contribute to the first principal component, as they are all placed on either side of the vertical line that passes through (0,0), whereas for the second principal component the major contributions are molecular weight and dipole moment. Only the first is used for the integer assignment in Fig. 2D, it is seen from the ordering that PCA gives an order which resonates well with chemical intuition. Triethylamine and DIPEA are assigned 1 and 2, respectively, and the pyridine-based bases are assigned (4-8) and according to steric hindrance. However, PCA also allows us to place bases with non-obvious positions, like DBU and aniline, on this spectrum. Since we wanted to include solvent mixtures, it was not possible to use a similar PCA approach to describe the solvents and they were instead described as a categorical variable. Four different solvents and all possible 1:1 combinations are included in the reaction space. With the reaction and reaction space established, the synthetic workflow was designed, and the robot was programmed accordingly. A flow diagram of the synthetic workflow and the script for the robot can be found in the ESI (Fig. $S8 \\dagger).$ As the robot did not have a module for handling solids, solid reagents were introduced as stock solutions. The sugars were dissolved in DMF and the benzoic anhydride in MeCN (4 M). Hence, it should be stressed that the optimal solvent in all cases is a solvent mixture with a minimum of two components, as a fixed amount of DMF and MeCN will be added to the mixture from these stock solutions. For the closed-loops utilizing the transfer learning approach an eighth parameter was included in the reaction space; ``sugar''. This parameter was constrained to the sugar used for the specific reaction optimized, but it allowed for the introduction of previous data from optimizations of benzoylation of different sugars into the database prior to running the closed-loop.\nInitial closed-loops\nFirst, a closed-loop optimization of the reaction with the reaction space shown in Fig. 2A was carried out (CL1). The results are shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that out of the first initial 12 experiments proposed using LHS only one experiment gives a non-zero yield. A steady increase in the yield is observed after 30 experiments and convergence seems to be reached after 63 experiments. The larger fluctuations observed in the plot of the yield as a function of experiment number (left plot) when using a higher xi value compared to a low xi-value is in accordance with the algorithm being more explorative. Whilst the smaller fluctuations observed when using a lower xi-value are in accordance with a more exploitive algorithm, where only minor changes are made to the reaction conditions, resulting in only small changes in the yield. The optimal conditions found by the ReactionOptimizer give a yield of 63$\\%$ and can be found in Table 2, entry 1. The optimal conditions include benzoic anhydride as the benzoylating reagent and triethylamine as the base, both in excess. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, the combination of benzoic anhydride and triethylamine, without other additives, has not been used for regioselective\nbenzoylations of carbohydrates before, thereby the ReactionOptimizer successfully located a novel and seemingly superior procedure. Since no precedence is found in the literature, this combination would likely be missed, had the optimization been carried out using chemical intuition.\nThe optimal solvent is a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and THF. How to include solvents and solvent mixtures is an obstacle when designing reaction spaces for Bayesian optimization of chemical reactions, though some solutions to this have been described in the literature. $^{45}$ Here we chose a sequential approach, and since the optimal solvent was found to be a mixture of two solvents a second closed-loop (CL2) was run. In this closed-loop the solvent composition was fixed to acetonitrile and THF, but the ratio of the two solvents was introduced as a new parameter. Further, the benzoylating reagent and base were fixed to benzoic anhydride and triethylamine, respectively. As the optimal conditions included the maximum amount of base in the reaction space, the maximum amount of base was increased from 16.7 to 30 equivalents. Instead of using initial random experiments, the algorithm was given the experimental data from the previous closed-loop. During this second closedloop the yield was increased from 63$\\%$ to 68$\\%$, the new set of optimal conditions can be found as entry 2 in Table 2. It is seen that the amount of base is increased to the new maximum, and, interestingly, the preferred solvent ratio is pure THF, which would also have been possible as the solvent in the first closedloop. Whether the reason for THF not being the optimal solvent in the first closed-loop is a consequence of the increased amount of base possible, or if it is simply not located, is unknown. It has previously been noted that the xi-changeover leads to a trade-off between time and improvement. It is possible, that if the optimizer had carried out more experiments before changing the xi-value THF might have been located as the optimal solvent in the first closed-loop.\nThe optimal conditions include a substantial excess of benzoylating reagent (2.88 equivalents), which is surprising as this could lead to over-benzoylation. Upon analyzing the distribution of compounds present in the reaction mixtures it was evident that the main components were the reactant, the 6monobenzoylated glucoside, and the 3,6-dibenzoylated glucoside (Fig. 4A). Pie charts showing the distribution of the three species in Fig. 4A for all experiments carried out during CL2 can be found in ESI (Fig. $S12 \\dagger).$ Hence, the dibenzoylation appears to be highly regioselective under conditions similar to those of CL2, and in the experiment containing most 3,6-dibenzoylated glucoside, the yield is 49$\\%$.\nA third closed-loop (CL3) was designed in order to optimize for the 3,6-dibenzoylated product. A reaction space similar to that of CL2 was chosen to allow for the experiments previously carried out during CL2 to be included as initial data. The results are shown in Fig. 4B. In general, high yields are observed and convergence is reached after 18 experiments, with a yield of 67$\\%$of the 3,6-O-benzoylated product. This is an improvement compared to CL1, where initial experiments were low yielding,\nand it took 63 experiments to reach convergence. This improvement might be ascribed to two important differences. First, the reaction space has been narrowed down since the benzoylating reagent and base have been fixed, which would make the optimization easier by decreasing the reaction space. Further, the use of 71 initial previous data points instead of 12 random initial experiments would give the Bayesian optimization algorithm a much better starting point. To further investigate the importance of initial previous data we decided to design a transfer learning approach.\nOptimization using transfer learning\nThe effect of including previous data from the exact same reaction is not very intriguing, since it is unlikely a lot of previous data can be found on that exact reaction one is optimizing. Therefore, we developed a transfer learning approach. where data from past tasks is used to accelerate the current, i.e. optimization results from one reaction is used for the optimization of different, but related reaction. In recent years, some examples of using transfer learning approaches to improve Bayesian optimization have been described. $^{46,47}$ However, to the best of our knowledge, transfer learning has not been applied to Bayesian optimization of chemical reactions. Though, transfer learning has been shown to successfully accelerate reaction optimization performed by random forest $classifiers^{48}$ and neural processes combined with Bayesian optimization. $^{49}$ We chose a simple approach where data from previous optimizations are included by introducing a new categorical variable, which allowed us to build initial optimization models using knowledge from previous optimizations, but without having to make changes to the algorithm. Data from other optimization will be referred to as \"initial previous\" data. It seems reasonable that the optimal conditions for one substrate are not necessarily optimal for a different substrate in all cases. However, the substrate specificity is often neglected, since performing reaction optimization on each substrate would be a tedious and time-consuming task, and in most cases, the effect is most likely minor. Though, within carbohydrate chemistry substrate specificity is a common problem due to the complex nature of carbohydrates caused by the many functional groups and stereogenic centers. Hence, substrate specific optimization could be beneficial in some cases, especially if the optimizations can be performed quickly by utilizing previous optimization data.\nwe decided to investigate the effect of including the data obtained from the initial optimizations of the benzoylation of the $\\beta -$ glucoside for a similar reaction, but with a different substrate. This transfer learning approach is illustrated in Fig. 5. The first new substrate is an a-thiomannoside and the key differences from the $\\beta -$ glucoside are the anomeric configuration, the configuration at C-2, and the exchange of oxygen to sulfur. Thioglycosides are an important class of glycosides since they can be utilized as glycosyl donors. $^{50}$ The reaction space can be seen in Fig. 6A, and the result from optimizing the monobenzoylation of the a-thiomannoside is shown in Fig. 6B. In total 71 reaction conditions and yields (data points) from the $\\beta -$ glucoside optimizations were provided by the ReactionOptimizer as ``initial previous'' data, instead of performing initial random experiments. Convergence is reached after only 23 experiments, compared to 63 experiments for the initial closed loop without transfer learning. Hence, it is a significant improvement, and it should be noted that the reaction space has been increased from the initial closed-loop optimization(Fig. 2) to the closed-loop optimizations (Fig. 6), as the ranges for the continuous parameters have been expanded. Similarly, the dibenzoylation of the a-thiomannoside was optimized and the results are shown in Fig. 6C.\nEdge Article\nBesides initial previous data from the $\\beta -$ glucoside optimizations, the data obtained for the optimization of the monobenzoylation of the a-thiomannoside was also provided to the ReactionOptimizer. Again, high yields are observed for most proposed conditions, and convergence is observed after 20 experiments (Fig. 6C).\nEncouraged by these results we decided to investigate how the transfer learning approach would influence the optimization of benzoylation reactions of a third substrate, where both the optimization data from the $\\beta -$ glucoside optimizations and the a-thiomannoside were included as previous initial data. For this a $\\beta -$ galactoside was chosen as the substrate. This time we started with optimizing the dibenzoylation to make sure the fast convergence for the closedloop optimization of the dibenzoylation of the a-thiomannoside was not a consequence of using previous data obtained from the specific substrate. Further, the second benzoylation is suspected to be more substrate specific as differences between the secondary alcohols are less pronounced than the difference between the primary alcohol and the secondaries, thereby the second benzoylation is more likely to be influenced by changes in the substrate's configuration. Albeit, as seen from Fig. 6D, the general picture of the optimization is very similar to that of the dibenzoylation optimization of the a-thiomannoside (Fig. 6C). Last, using all the gathered optimization data the monobenzoylation of the $\\beta -$ galactoside was optimized (Fig. 6E). No significant change in convergence time is observed between the closed-loop optimizations of the mono and dibenzoylation of the a-thiomannoside (23 and 20 experiments) and the corresponding closed-loop optimization for the $\\beta -$ galactoside (17 and 21 experiments). This indicates that initial previous data is beneficial, but that the amount of initial previous data can be saturated so that adding more data will no longer improve the convergence time. It is seen that in general, the proposed reaction conditions give yields, which are comparable to most existing literature procedures, for similar reactions. $^{11,16,23,26,31,34-36,51-53}$ Moderately higher yielding procedures can be found in the $literature^{11,16,23,26,31,34-36,51-53}$ for the synthesis of the compound, however, the simplicity and speed of our new procedures makes this benzoylated sugars more easily accessible.\nOptimal reaction conditions\nThe optimal conditions found in each closed-loop are shown in Table 3. All conditions except entry 4 include benzoic anhydride as the benzoylating reagent. Interestingly, entries 4 and 5 are from the same closed-loop and give the same yield but with very different conditions. The optimal reagents in entry 4 are benzoyl chloride and 2,6-lutidine, whereas for entry 4 it is benzoic anhydride and triethylamine. Hence, the ReactionOptimizer has been able to find two different optima within the same closed-loop. For all the conditions with benzoic anhydride, as the benzoylations reagent, the optimal base is found to be triethylamine, except for entry 7 (dibenzoylation of mannoside), where the preferred base is DIPEA. In general, the optimal conditions include large amounts of base and high concentrations. Surprisingly, an excess of benzoylating reagent is observed for all the conditions in Table 3. The optimal equivalent of benzoylating reagent for the monobenzoylation are 2.9,3.7, and 4.2 (entries 2, 5, and 8, respectively), and for the dibenzoylations, the optimal equivalents of benzoylating reagent are 5.9, 8.1, and 8.2 (entries 3, 6, and 7). Thus, noteworthy differences in the optimal amount of benzoylating reagent are observed for the different substrates, with exception of entries 6 and 7. The large amounts of benzoylating reagent observed might be due to the relatively short fixed reaction time of 1 hour. Furthermore, the optimal solvent also seems to be substrate dependent, as three different solvents are selected as the optimal solvent: a mixture of THF and acetonitrile, pure THF, or dioxane. In conclusion, most of the optimal conditions have some similarities but also significant differences, consequently, substrate specificity is to be considered within carbohydrate chemistry and organic synthesis. It is seen that the newly discovered combination of triethylamine and benzoic anhydride is optimal in most of both the mono and dibenzoylations.\nNext, we were interested in investigating the transferability of the procedures to our everyday manual laboratory work. This was done by carrying out the experiments in Table 3 without using the robot and with standard laboratory equipment. A procedure similar to the experimental procedure encoded in the robot was followed. However, one major change to the automated procedure was necessary as the reactions were quenched using methanol by the robot. This\nwas adequate for the UPLC analysis, but when trying to purify the compounds by flash column chromatography the ester biproduct was co-eluting, and as excess benzoylating was required in all cases, methyl benzoate ended up being the major component of the crude reaction mixture, which was not desirable. We, therefore, chose to quench the reactions with dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) instead of methanol, as this gives rise to benzoic acid and an amide as byproducts, which both can be removed by an aqueous workup. $^{54}$ Since the sugars and benzoic anhydride were added as stock solutions during the automated experiments, stock solutions were also utilized during the manual experiments.\nThe detailed manual experimental procedure can be found in ESI.* It was possible to carry out two experiments a day, whereas the automated setup approximately carried out 12 experiments within 24 hours. The results from careering out the manual experiments can be found in the last column in Table 3. In some cases, only the sugar of interest and very minor residues of other carbohydrates were observed from crude NMR, the crude yield for these reactions are therefore included in parenthesis (spectra of the crude products can be found in ESI $\\dagger).$ For entries 2, 3, 5, and 8 the manually obtained yields are comparable to the UPLC yields obtained from the closed-loops. Though, for entries 4, 6, and 7 the manually obtained yields are significantly lower. When caring out the manual experiment in entry 4 only a trace amount of the desired product was observed by NMR and only minor conversion of the starting material was observed. Upon manual addition of the benzoyl chloride, vapor formation was observed over the reaction mixture, which is suspected to be caused by HCl gas formation. The discrepancy between the UPLC yield and the manually obtained yield could be a consequence of the differences between the manual and automated setup. The reactions are carried out by the robot in vials, which are open for a significant amount of time after adding the benzoyl chloride. Contrary, the manually performed reactions are carried out in a round-bottomed flask with a septum and a balloon filled with nitrogen, which might cause a difference in reaction conditions, atmosphere, and, consequently, the yield. The drop in yield for entries 6 and 7, which are the optimal conditions for the dibenzoylation of the mannoside and galactoside, respectively, could be due to benzoyl group migration. From the crude spectra, a complex mixture of benzoylated species is observed, unlike what was observed by UPLC analysis in the automated experiments. Therefore, we suspect that the new quenching procedure might facilitate migration of the benzoyl groups. Migration of acyl groups is a known problem within carbohydrate chem- $istry^{55}$ and is more likely if the kinetic product is higher in energy than the thermodynamic products. In addition, the reactions performed by the automated setup are run under ambient conditions, even though no effort has been made to dry the solvents or glassware in the case of the manually performed experiments differences in atmosphere composition and water residue are expected, which could impact the reactions. Furthermore, the automated reactions have been performed on a 50 mg scale, whereas the manually performed reactions have been performed on a 250 mg scale. The deviation between the manual experiments and the ones performed by the robot seems to be a consequence of parameters that impact the reaction, but which have not been considered as variables, in the sense, that the developed conditions are not scale and equipment independent.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have optimized the selective protection of fully unprotected glycosides in a fully automated closed-loop setup. In addition, we have shown that the methodology can be expanded to alternative substrates with very little additional effort by using a novel transfer learning approach, where previous data from optimizations of similar reactions are included by introducing a new categorical variable. In this way, the optimizations can be accelerated, though at some point the algorithm will be saturated with previous data and adding more data will not have an influence. Using the automated setup, we were able to locate a set of optimal reaction conditions involving triethylamine and benzoic anhydride, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been applied for regioselective benzoylations of unprotected glycosides without further additives. The final procedures are fast, simple, and carried out under ambient conditions without specialized equipment. Further, the procedures only include reagents present in most chemistry laboratories. We also found that it is important to consider the transferability from the automated setup to the laboratory early in the project design, as the automated setup only considers the reaction, and optimizing the process, which will be the next step, can be complicated by limitations arising from the initial design of the automated setup. The study also gave an insight into the importance of considering substrate specificity. Both similarities and notable differences between the optimal reaction conditions were observed for each\ncarbohydrate substrate, which suggests that substrate specificity is important to consider when performing reaction optimization.\nData availability\nThe experimental methods and datasets that support this article are available in the ESI.*\nAuthor contributions\nNVF: project design, data acquisition, data analysis, synthesis, writing of scripts, and writing of the original draft.

Walczak iD *c and Feng Zhu iD *a\nC-Glycosyl peptides possess excellent metabolic stability and therapeutic properties and thus play critical roles in biological studies as well as drug discoveries. However, the limited accessibility of C-glycosyl amino acids has significantly hindered the broader research of their structural features and mode of action. Herein, for the first time we disclose a novel visible-light-driven radical conjugate addition of 1,4-dihydropyridine(DHP)-derived glycosyl esters with dehydroalanine derivatives, generating C-glycosyl amino acids and Cglycosyl peptides in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Redox-active glycosyl esters, as readily accessible and bench-stable radical precursors, could be easily converted to glycosyl radicals via anomeric C( $sp^{3})-O$ bond homolysis under mild conditions. Importantly, the generality and practicality of this transformation were fully demonstrated in >40 examples including 2-dexosugars, oligosaccharides, oligopeptides, and complex drug molecules. Given its mild reaction conditions, robust sugar scope, and high anomeric control and diastereoselectivity, the method presented herein could find widespread utility in the preparation of C( $sp^{3})-$ linked sugar-based peptidomimetics.\nIntroduction\nGlycoproteins are widely present on the cell surface and play irreplaceable roles in a wide range of biological processes, such as immune response, signal transduction, and cell adhesion. $^{1,2}$ In nature, most of the glycopeptides/proteins bear O/N-glycosidic linkages, and the only known form of C-glycosidic linkage is found to be the Mana1-C2-Trp motif. $^{3}$ While glycopeptides/proteins hold promise as novel therapeutic and diagnostic tools, the labile O/N-glycosidic bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis and enzymatic cleavage potentially hindering their widespread utility in drug discovery. 4 As a result, it is of great interest to replace the hydrolysable O/N-glycosidic linkage with a more stable C-, S- or Se-linked analogue. $^{5,6}$ Given their remarkable resistance to hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation and innate drug-like properties, C-glycosides have emerged as a robust surrogate of the native O/N-glycoconjugate with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.7 Within this class, C-alkyl glycoamino acids and glycopeptides are becoming the focus of various studies of biological functions and disease models, as well as in the design of therapeutic peptides. $^{8}$ For example, peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics, including Nikkomycin Z $1^{9}$ and Amipurimycin $2,^{10}$ show excellent antimycotic activities. Furthermore, glycosylation as an effective synthetic strategy can significantly improve the bioavailability of endogenous peptides,11 for instance, C-linked glycosyl decapeptide $3,^{12}$ [(aGal) $Ala^{7}]$ dermorphin $4,^{13}$ and galactosylated-NAPamide 5(ref. 14) (Fig. 1a).\nIn comparison to the well-developed O/N- $glycosylation^{2,3,15}$ or S/Se- $glycosylation^{16-19}$ of amino acids or peptides, C-glycosylation of amino acids or peptides is much more challenging and has lagged far behind. $^{20}$ Although outstanding progress has been recently made in the synthesis of C( $sp^{2})-$ linked glycoamino acids and glycopeptides, $^{21-23}$ the precise preparation of C-alkyl analogues remains a longstanding challenge. $^{20}$ Given the highdensity functionalization of peptides and acidic nature of the aposition of amino acids, the conventional methods to prepare C-alkyl glycosides become frequently futile for C-alkyl glycoamino acids or glycopeptides. $^{24,25}$ Gagn'e and co-workers reported an indirect approach to C-alkyl glycoamino acids using\nC-glycosyl aldehydes 6 as key intermediates (Fig. $1b),^{26}$ which promoted the research on the photoredox-mediated synthesis of C-glycoamino acids. Recently, significant efforts have been directed toward the preparation of C-glycosyl glycines 10, with key contributions from Wang, $^{27}$ Wang, $^{28}$ Xu, $^{29}$ and Liang. $^{30}$ Of particular note, these elegant approaches are applicable to Cglycosyl alanines 13. Notable advances have been achieved in Pd-catalyzed $\\beta -C$ ( $sp^{3})-H$ glycosylation of amino acids and peptides with 1-iodoglycals 12, as reported independently by $Liu^{31}$ and $Ackermann^{32}$ using triazolyldimethylmethyl triazole and aminoquinoline as directing groups, respectively (Fig. 1b). This powerful strategy may not be compatible with oligosaccharides due to the intrinsic instability of 1-iodoglycals 12, and the further hydroboration/oxidation reaction of C-alkyl-\nsubstituted glycals 13 obtaining sugars in a mixture of diastereomers. $^{31}$ Recently, $Niu^{33}$ and $Koh^{34,35}$ have developed novel methods for the synthesis of C-alkyl glycopeptides through the Giese reaction of glycosyl radicals to peptides 15 on the Nterminus, utilizing novel glycosyl sulfoxides, sulfones and common glycosyl chlorides as glycosyl precursors 14, respectively. However, the use of stoichiometric amounts of radical initiators or reductants and the synthesis of 2-deoxy saccharides and oligosaccharides remain crucial issues. Therefore, a general and concise method to attain alkyl C-amino acids or glycopeptides from readily available starting materials under mild conditions is still a formidable challenge. Radical glycosylation has become a highly active area of research, owing to its excellent chemoselectivity and good anomeric control. $^{5,36}$ Various unnatural glycosyl derivatives are extensively explored as glycosyl radical precursors, including glycosyl halides, $^{37}$ xanthates, $^{38}$ sulfones, $^{39}$ glycosyl-based DHPS, $^{40,41}$ glycosyl carboxylic $acids^{42,43}$ redox-active esters, $^{27,44}$ and anomeric nucleophiles. $^{45,46}$ It is worth noting that multi-step synthesis, inherent instability, special reaction conditions and narrow sugar scope remain as several of the key obstacles reducing the practical value of these unnatural glycosyl derivatives. Undoubtedly, the ideal generation of glycosyl radicals is the direct homolytic cleavage of anomeric C( $sp^{3})-$ OH bonds of native carbohydrates. However, anomeric C( $sp^{3})-O$ bond homolysis poses a significant challenge because the BDE of the anomeric C( $sp^{3})-$ OH $(\\sim 99$ kcal $mol^{-1}$ for furanose and $\\sim 101$ kcal $mol^{-1}$ for pyranose) is even higher than that of an alcohol $(\\sim 96$ kcal $mol^{-1}).^{47}$ In general, various redox auxiliaries that include xanthates, $^{48,49}$ phosphites, $^{50}$ oxalates, $^{51,52}$ carboxylates, $^{53,54}$ and $ethers^{55}$ have been employed to transform hydroxyl groups into activating groups to generate C-radical intermediates under electron transfer or light irradiation. Unfortunately, most of the above redox auxiliaries are not suitable for carbohydrate substrates, possibly due to the instability of the corresponding glycosyl esters at the anomeric position. $^{33,45,46,56}$ Recently, dihydropyridine (DHP) as a versatile activating group has been successively applied in various radical glycosylation reactions via C-C bond cleavage at the C4 or C5 position of sugars. $^{40,41,57}$ To homolytically cleave challenging anomeric C( $sp^{3})-O$ bonds, DHPs were used as redox auxiliaries to obtain stable glycosyl esters and then C-aryl and C-acyl glycosides via sequential C-C and C-O bond cleavage under nickel/photoredox dual catalysis were successfully achieved. $^{53,54}$ In comparison to most of the glycosyl radical precursors, the redox glycosyl DHP esters are very impressive because of their easy accessibility, stability, and compatibility with 2-deoxysugars. However, studies on C( $sp^{3})-$ glycosylation of DHP-derived glycosyl esters and the reactivity and compatibility of DHP groups in complex oligosaccharides remain unexplored.\nIn order to provide a meaningful solution to these fundamental issues and in line with our interest on the precise preparation of carbohydrates and modification of complex peptides, $^{36,58}$ we herein disclose the first example of photoredox-catalyzed radical conjugated addition of DHP-derived glycosyl esters 17 with highly reactive dehydroalanine (Dha) 18 for the synthesis of C( $sp^{3})-$ glycosyl amino acids and peptides via anomeric C-O bond homolysis (Fig. 1c). This novel glycosylation method advances the development of catalytic methods applicable to complex and challenging carbohydrate substrates and complements the current state-of-the art methodologies.\nResults and discussion\nReaction development\nThe visible-light-driven radical conjugate addition (RAC) of Dhas is a powerful tool to access nonproteinogenic amino acids, peptides, and proteins. $^{59}$ In particular, diastereoselective radical addition to chiral Karady-Beckwith Dhas is becoming an attractive method for the precise preparation of a-amino acid derivatives. $^{60}$ Based on the high diastereocontrol, the model reaction of O-mannofuranosyl ester 17a (1.5 equiv) with Karady-Beckwith Dha 18 (1.0 equiv) to afford C-alkyl glycoamino acid 19a was used to optimize reaction conditions (Table 1). To our delight, the desired C-alkyl glycoamino acid 19a was isolated in 69$\\%$ yield with excellent anomeric control (only a isomer) and diastereoselectivity around the oxazolidinone auxiliary (d.r.>20:1) after 10 h of irradiation with blue light emitting diodes (LEDs, 6 W) in the presence of a common photocatalyst Ir[dF( $CF_{3})$ ppy $]_{2}$ (dtbbpy) $PF_{6}$ PC1 in 1,4-dioxane (entry 1). When MeCN or THF was used as an alternative solvent, the isolated yields were reduced to 52$\\%$ and 33$\\%$, respectively (entries 2-3). Further modifications of the reaction conditions, such as the modified ratio of 17a : 18 (entry 4), had only negative effects on the reaction yields. Similarly, reduced or elevated temperatures reduced the yield of 19a (entry 5). We hypothesize that lower temperature might not provide sufficient driving force for the sequential C-C and C-O bond cleavage of glycosyl DHP esters(confirmed by the recovery of 17a), whereas higher temperatures result in the oxidation of the glycosyl donor to 19a[ox] bearing a pyridine motif. We further probed the reaction conditions with different photocatalysts under blue LED irradiation (entries 6-8). While no reaction was observed using Ir(ppy $)_{3}\\space($ PC2) and Ru(bpy) $_{3}Cl_{2}($ PC3), about 7$\\%$ of 19a was isolated when inexpensive 4CzIPN (PC4) was employed. To our delight, simply changing the solvent to MeCN led to a 64$\\%$ yield of the desired product using PC4 as the photocatalyst (entry 9). Subsequently, increasing the amount of PC4 and extending the reaction time further improved the yields to 70$\\%$ and 82$\\%$, respectively (entries 10 and 11). Extended exposure of the reaction to light radiation and changing the concentration to 0.67 M led to further improvement of the isolated yield of 19a to 85$\\%$ (entry 12). Using the same strategy, the desired glycosyl amino acid 19a was obtained in an 80$\\%$ yield using PC1 as a photocatalyst after 10 h of irradiation (entry 13). Notably, the radical addition reaction can also be conducted in a 3 : 1 mixture of MeCN and $H_{2}O$ with 78$\\%$ isolated yield of 19a (for details, see the ESI $\\dagger).$ Finally, control experiments demonstrated the necessity of a photocatalyst and visible light for the alkyl Cglycosylation reaction to take place (entry 14).\nScope of monosaccharides\nWith the optimal reaction conditions established, we next focused on testing the scope of DHP-derived glycosyl esters. As shown in Fig. 2, a broad range of structurally diverse glycosyl\nt-Bu\nPC1(2.0mo1$\\%$)\no=\nDHP\nCbz、\nCbz\nH\n10\nt.Bu\n$85 ^\\circ\\text{C} .10h$\nH\n17a\n18\n19a 20:1\nDHP esters derived from various monosaccharides and oligosaccharides underwent the radical addition smoothly and produced the corresponding alkyl C-glycosylamino acids 19b19w in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereoselectivity around the oxazolidinone auxiliary. D-Ribofuranoses with various common protecting groups, such as benzoyl(19b), acetyl (19c), silyl (19d), and benzyl (19e and 19f), readily underwent the alkyl C-glycosylation, affording 19b-19f in 5787$\\%$ isolated yields. Other glycosyl NHP esters derived from common furanoses, including D-xylofuranose (19g), D-arabinofuranose (19h), and 2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose (19i), produced the corresponding radical addition products (19g-19i) in good yields. The opposite anomeric stereoselectivity between D-arabinofuranose 19h and 2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose 19i reflects a dominating effect of the C2 substituent group on the stereochemical outcome because of the steric hindrance. $^{34,54}$ These results stand in contrast to the reported methods on radical addition of glycosyl radicals, $^{33-35}$ and 2-deoxy-D-ribofuranosyl NHP esters show good reactivity and selectivity under the standard conditions due to their excellent stability and generation of glycosyl radicals under mild photoredox conditions. Subsequently, a variety of common pyranoses, such as D-mannopyranose, D-mannosamine, D-galactopyranose, L-\nrhamnopyranose, and 2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, were readily transformed into alkyl C-glycoamino acids 19j-19r with good to excellent stereoselectivities (Fig. 2b). The suboptimal yields of fully protected monosaccharides with disarmed protected groups, such as 19l, 19m and 19q, could be attributed to the low nucleophilicity of the corresponding glycosyl radicals. Importantly, 2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, proved to be a competent substrate for the radical addition with high a-selectivity despite the lack of the controlling C2 substituent. The stereochemistry of all cross-coupling products was further confirmed by 2D COSY and HSQC analyses (see the ESIt for details). In general, the stereochemical outcome of desired products could be explained by a combination of the anomeric and steric effects. $^{61,62}$\nScope of oligosaccharidesTo further expand the scope of the alkyl C-glycosylation reaction, we then investigated the reactions of DHP esters derived from complex oligosaccharides (Fig. 2c). As mentioned above, most of the current methods for the formation of alkyl Cglycosides are limited to the reactions with monosaccharides, and the direct stereoselective C-glycosylation with free radical\nprecursors of oligosaccharides and Michael acceptors is rare. These limitations could be attributed to the incompatibility of free radical precursors with oligosaccharide synthesis and the lack of effective methods to generate and stabilize oligosaccharide radicals. We found that oligosaccharide DHP esters could be easily prepared on a gram scale by simple coupling of DHP acids and C1-hemiacetals (24-53$\\%$) and remain bench stable for several months. To our delight, disaccharide DHP esters could be engaged in cross-coupling reactions without any significant modifications of the standard conditions, allowing for the formation of alkyl C-disaccharides 19s and 19t in 72$\\%$and 64$\\%$ isolated yields with good to excellent stereoselectivity. The scope of the radical glycosylation could be further extended to more complex oligosaccharides and the radical C-glycosylation reactions forming alkyl C-trisaccharides (19u and 19v) and a tetrasaccharide (19w) produced the corresponding products in yields exceeding 65$\\%$ with d.r.>20:1.\nScope of pharmacophore-coupled monosaccharides\nBesides the well-known antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) are gaining recognition as a novel modality for targeted drug delivery with improved efficacy and reduced side effects for cancer therapy. $^{63}$ The linker between the peptide and drug plays a critical role in the circulation time of the conjugate and release of the drug for full activity at the target site. Therefore, the research to develop effective linkers for the design of PDCs is important and promising. Herein, we were intrigued by the viability of the visible-light driven radical C-glycosylation of pharmacophorecoupled glycosyl DHP esters and substrate 18 (Fig. 2d). To our delight, the bioconjugation reactions using sugars as linkers proved reliable and a series of glycosyl DHP esters derived from D-ribofuranose and p-mannopyranose could be coupled with commercial drugs, including Febuxostat, Isoxepac, Oxaprozin, and Adapalene, affording the corresponding products 19x-19aa in 45-56$\\%$ yield. The above results revealed that our method exhibits remarkable potential application in rapid assembly of glycopeptide drug molecules.\nScope of Dha amino acids and peptides\nEncouraged by the above results, we next investigated the radical addition of O-mannofuranosyl esters 17a to various amino acids and Dha peptides (Fig. 3). We hypothesized that the efficiency of radical addition will be correlated with different protecting groups located on the nitrogen atom with the electron-withdrawing group promoting the addition of a nucleophilic radical. In addition to chiral Dha 18, bis-N-Bocprotected, bis-N-Ac-protected, Boc-N-methyl protected and bisN-phthalimide protected Dha were all effectively transformed into the desired product in 49-86$\\%$ isolated yields; however, trace product was detected when N-Boc-protected or N-Acprotected Dha was used. This observation is consistent with the prior studies highlighting the importance of the torsional angle $[ \\omega(C=C-N-C)]$ between the plane of the olefin and the\ncarbamate that might contribute to the disparate reactivity. $^{64}$ The introduction of two bulky N-protected groups or a cyclic structure weakens the conjugation effect of the nitrogen lone pair into the adjoining $\\pi$ system and significantly decreases the electronic density of the terminus of the olefin to improve the efficiency of radical addition. Capitalizing on these results, we then studied a series of Dha-containing dipeptides and tripeptides, such as cyclic Dha-Phe 20e, Dha-Tyr 20f, Dha-Ser 20g, Dha-Gly 20h, Dha-Asp 20i, Dha-Met 20j, Dha-Cys 20k, Dha-D-Trp 20l, Dha-Ile-Leu 20m, and Dha-Ile-Val 20n, all of which smoothly deliver the corresponding mannofuranosyl peptides in acceptable yields (34-65$\\%$) with excellent anomeric selectivity and chemoselectivity. Importantly, this mild radical C-glycosylation between oligopeptides such as tetrapeptide(Dha-IIe-Leu-Phe) and sugar DHP ester was also conducted in 62$\\%$ yield, which further highlighted the generality of this method in late-stage glycodiversification of complex oligopeptides. $^{19,33}$ As we all know, radical additions to Dha derivatives often result in mixtures of diastereomers, presenting a significant challenge in peptide modification. In contrast to the highly stereoselective outcomes observed with chiral Karady-Beckwith Dha 18, peptides containing Dha exhibit moderate diastereoselectivity due to the limited steric hindrance and electronic effects. However, it is worth emphasizing that recent studies have demonstrated the potential of catalytic systems composed of transition metals and chiral ligands to achieve stereoselective radical additions to peptides containing Dha. $^{65}$\nApplication\nThe practicality of this method was demonstrated by a gramscale synthesis of 19a (77$\\%$ yield in a 3.0 mmol scale reaction) as shown in Fig. 4a. One of the objectives of this study is to provide an efficient method for the preparation of alkyl Cglycosyl amino acids/peptides and establish a general method for the late-stage functionalization of complex molecules. To demonstrate the generality of deoxygenative radical addition, we prepared DHP ester 22a derived from natural product(+)-sclareolide and engaged it in visible-light photoredoxcatalyzed radical addition to afford 22b in 61$\\%$ yield with 4:1 d.r (Fig. 4b). It is well known that $\\beta -$ thiolated amino acid derivatives not only play important roles in regulating the function and conformation of proteins, but also serve as important units for peptide design and bioconjugation. However, the difficulty in obtaining enantiopure $\\beta -$ thiolated amino acids with diverse structures is a major limitation to their widespread application. Recently, the Wang group developed an interesting photoredox-catalyzed Giese reaction of chiral thiazolidines to access enantiopure $\\beta -$ thiolated amino acids. $^{66}$ Inspired by this, we wondered whether our method could be applied to prepare $\\beta -$ thiolated amino acids containing sugar units, which are difficult to obtain using conventional methods. Gratifyingly, new chiral thiazolidines 23 could be smoothly transformed into $\\beta -$ thiolated amino acids containing sugar units 24 (67$\\%$) with excellent diastereoselectivity (Fig. 4c). As illustrated in Fig. 4d, the deprotection of the cyclic group on compound 19k with LiOH provided glycosyl amino acids 25 in 70$\\%$ yield, which can be easily converted into side chain Cglycosylated dipeptides 26 in 59$\\%$ with>20:1 d.r. under standard peptide coupling conditions. Finally, to further illustrate the effective complementarity of our method to existing methods, the model reaction of glycosyl chlorides 27 using Ticatalyzed conditions was conducted, providing the desired product in only 18$\\%$ isolated yield (Fig. $4e).^{34,35}$\nMechanistic studies\nTo gain more insights into the reaction mechanism, several control experiments were conducted as outlined in Fig. 5. First, the model reactions were carried out in the presence of radical scavengers TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) and DPE (1,1-diphenylethylene), which reduced the yield of 19a to<5$\\%$ and 42$\\%$, respectively (Fig. 5a). In the radical trapping experiments with glycosyl radicals, Tempol glycosides were not detected due to their further decomposition under blue irradiation. $^{67}$ Gratefully, the radical addition products of glycosyl radicals with DPE 28 and alkoxycarbonyl radicals with DPE 29 are detected by HRMS. Thus, these results suggest that the reaction path of this process is a radical pathway. Next, deuterium labeling experiments to probe the origin of the hydrogen source were performed (Fig. 5b). The model reaction with $d_{3}-$ MeCN as solvent was found to give product 19a in 67$\\%$ yield with no deuterium incorporation, suggesting that any hydrogen atom transfer with solvent MeCN is less likely. Additionally, in a mixture of MeCN and $D_{2}O, \\space d-19a$ was obtained in 82$\\%$ yield with>99$\\%$ deuterium incorporated at the a-site of the amino acid precursor, which indicates that a carbanion might be involved in the transformation. Furthermore, a light on-off experiment was carried out with 17a and 18 (Fig. 5c). We found that 19a was only obtained during the periods of constant irradiation.\nThese results indicate that the reaction underwent a catalytic radical process rather than a radical chain pathway. Taken together, these data support the proposal that the NH group of DHP ester serves as a hydrogen atom source. Additionally, a pair of NHP esters 30a and 30b that differ only by the O atom vs. a $CH_{2}$ group were prepared and subjected to the standard conditions (Fig. 5d). While 30a was smoothly converted to 31a in 48$\\%$ isolated yield, the all-carbon analog 30b failed to deliver the Giese addition product 31b and was completely consumed due to decomposition. These findings demonstrate that aoxygen atoms are significant to facilitate the C-O bond homolysis, and the resulting carbon radicals are stabilized by the adjacent ion pair of oxygen atoms. $^{68}$ These observations were further supported by the DFT calculations for 30a and 30b summarized in Fig. 6. To reduce the computational cost and complexity, we simplify the process of producing free radicals by homolysis of C-O bonds without PC. While the homolytic cleavage of the DHP esters results in cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran radicals 33 of almost identical energies, the fragmentation of 33 is strongly controlled by the presence of a heteroatom which facilitates the expulsion of $CO_{2}$ by 7.0 kcal $mol^{-1}.$ The resultant radicals show differential NBO atomic\n$NCO_{2}Me$\nX\n34\n37\n72.8[88.2]\n62.8[64.8]\n65.8[81.7]\n$CO_{2}$\n33\n60.1[62.8]\nNCO2Me\n$MeO_{2}C$ 、\nNH\nX\n38\n51.4[66.2]\n$NCO_{2}Me$\n$CO_{2}Me$\n3526.5[51.8]\n$NCO_{2}Me$\n27.4[29.1]\n$\\times$\n206\n26.0[92.6]\n27.2[29.0]\n36\n$MeO_{2}C$\nNH\n12.7[37.7]\nX\n30a,X=O\\\\30b,X= $CH_{2}$\n12.0[38.2]\n0.0[0.0]\nCO2Me\ncharges (0.132 and -0.100 for O and $CH_{2}$ substituents, respectively) but comparable spin distributions (0.850 and 0.950, respectively), which translate into the fate of the subsequent reactions with a Michael acceptor. The conjugate addition with 36 shows $\\sim 2.7$ kcal $mol^{-1}$ acceleration for the heteroatom-stabilized radicals, whereas the following steps yield structures 38 and 39 with comparable energies slightly favoring the carbocycle over the oxygen-substituted derivative. We attribute the overall efficiency of the Giese addition to the efficiency of the initial radial generation, which can then be engaged in a productive reaction with a competent acceptor.\nBased on the above-mentioned preliminary and literature reports, $^{54}$ the following mechanism for this radical reaction mechanism is proposed (Fig. 7). Under blue LED irradiation, the photocatalyst [PC] is excited to its triple state [PC]*, which promotes the SET oxidation of A to B followed by deprotonation and radical fragmentation to generate the corresponding alkoxycarbonyl radical C and Hantzsch pyridine D. The subsequent decarboxylation is driven by the ejection of $CO_{2}$ and generates the active glycosyl radical E. The addition of E to chiral Dha gives rise to the radical intermediate F. Finally, the resulting radical F undergoes SET with the reduced\nMe\nEtooc\nMe\nPO\ncooet\nA\nMe\nEtOOC\nt-Bu\n[PC]*\nSET\nMe\nPO\ncbz\nPO\nCOOEt\nH\n[PC]\nphotoredox cycle\n[PC]\nEtooc\nMe\nSET\ntheation deprotonation radicaltion\nEtooc\nMe\nH+\ntBu\nradical addition\ndecarboxylation\nPO\nCbz\nt-Bu\nPo\nPO\nG\nPO\nCbz\n$CO_{2}$\nCbz\nt-Bu\nChem.Sci,2023,14,7569-7580|7577\nphotocatalyst [PC $]^{\\cdot -}$ to provide, after protonation, the desired product H and close the catalytic cycle.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we have developed the first visible-light photoredox catalyzed C( $sp^{3})-$ glycosylation of redox-active glycosyl DHP esters with dehydroalanine (Dha) derivatives via anomeric C-O bond homolysis for the concise synthesis of alkyl C-glycoamino acids and C-glycosyl peptides. By taking advantage of mild photocatalytic conditions, the novel alkyl C-glycosylation is compatible with a wide variety of carbohydrate substrates and Dha peptides, providing various C-glycoamino acids and Cglycopeptides in good yields with excellent anomeric control and good diastereoselectivity. Importantly, readily accessible and bench-stable glycosyl DHP esters smoothly participate in the radical glycosylation, allowing for efficient access to Cglycosyl alanine moieties involving challenging sugars, such as 2-deoxysugars and oligosaccharides. Therefore, this alkyl Cglycosylation of glycosyl esters via anomeric C-O bond homolysis not only promotes the development of radical glycosylation, but also provides a powerful tool for glycopeptide therapeutic discoveries. Furthermore, the integration of our method with the emerging technologies in peptide and protein chemistry, such as encoded libraries and direct bioconjugation, is currently ongoing in our laboratory.\nData availability\nThe authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study, including experimental details and compound characterization, are available within the article and its ESI $\\div$ file.

Horsley Downie, Axel Jacobi von Wangelin, Julia Rehbein,* and Robert Wolf*\nDedicated to Professor Rhett Kempe on the occasion of his $60^{th}$ birthday\nAbstract: We show that countercations exert a remarkable influence on the ability of anionic cobaltate salts to catalyze challenging alkene hydrogenations. An evaluation of the catalytic properties of [Cat][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod) $_{2}]$ (Cat=K(1),Na(2),Li $(3),(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg(4),and $N(^{n}Bu)_{4}(5)$ ;cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene, $^{Dep}$ nacnac=\\{2,6- $Et_{2}C_{6}H_{3}$ NC( $CH_{3})\\}_{2}$ CH)]) demonstrated that the lithium salt 3 and magnesium salt 4 drastically outperform the other catalysts. Complex 4 was the most active catalyst, which readily promotes the hydrogenation of highly congested alkenes under mild conditions. A plausible catalytic mechanism is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Furthermore, combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and DFT studies were used to examine the turnover-limiting migratory insertion step. The results of these studies suggest an active co-catalytic role of the counterion in the hydrogenation reaction through the coordination to cobalt hydride intermediates.\nIntroduction\nThe hydrogenation of alkenes is among the most widely utilized reactions for the synthesis of petrochemical intermediates, fine chemicals, drugs, agrochemicals, and nutrients. $^{[1,2]}$ Noble metals such as rhodium, palladium and iridium are routinely used as catalysts owing to their high reactivity, high selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and ease of operation. $^{[3]}$ However, growing environmental and economic awareness has emphasized more sustainable technologies including the use of first row transition metals due to their higher abundance in the Earth's crust. $^{[4]}$ As a result, the development of effective hydrogenation protocols with Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni has gained traction over the last decade. $^{[5]}$ Among them, anionic pre-catalysts, such as(ene)metalate salts (M=Fe, Co, Ni) and heteroleptic diimine cobaltates, have been shown to exhibit high catalytic activity for unbiased and bulky alkenes (Figure $1A).^{[6-9]}$ While the modular nature of such metalate pre-catalysts has enabled large variations of the ligands and metal ions, the potential of adopting counterion-sensitive mechanisms has so far not been investigated. Despite the availability of numerous anionic organometallic reagents and coordination complexes, $^{[10]}$ detailed studies of countercation effects on molecular reactivity have remained scarce and have only recently gained greater recognition. $^{[11,12]}$ For example, Miller and co-workers demonstrated the cooperative effect of alkali metal cation binding in the Ir-catalyzed isomerization of allylbenzene (Figure $1B).^{[13]}$ Addition of 1-4mol$\\%$ $MBAr_{4}^{F}\\space(M=$ Li, Na, K; $Ar^{F}=3,5-$ bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) to the iridium catalyst drastically increased the rate of isomerization to $\\beta -$ methylstyrene with turnover frequencies ranging from $1.8 \\space h^{-1}\\space(M=K)$ to $2000 \\space h^{-1}\\space(M=$ Li). Kempe and co-workers observed a remarkable influence of the alkali metal cation on the manganese catalyzed imine hydrogenation (Figure $1C).^{[14]}$ Alteration of the cocatalytic alkoxide base MO'Bu (M=K, Na, Li) accelerates the reaction following the trend $: \\space K^{+}>Na^{+}>$ An outersphere mechanism was proposed, in which a potassium cation actively participates in the rate-determining hydride transfer step. Similar observations have been made for Rucatalyzed (asymmetric) Noyori-type hydrogenations. $^{[15]}$\nPrevious studies from our group documented a strong counterion effect in the hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene(cod) with bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN) cobaltates [M(thf $)_{n}][(^{Dipp}$ BIAN)Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod)] (M=Li, n=3.5; M=K, n=1) used as catalysts. $^{[7]}$ Using the lithium cobaltate generated 61 $\\%$ cyclooctene, while the potassium analogue gave only 1$\\%$. We reasoned that such behavior could be more general and provide an additional parameter for catalyst optimization.\nHerein, we report a strong countercation effect on the catalytic hydrogenation of bulky alkenes with homoleptic\nFigure 1.

The topicity of the catalytic system and the reaction-time profile is investigated by $H_{2}$ uptake studies. Combined molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) studies indicate an active role of the counterion in the turnoverlimiting migratory insertion step via a $M- \\mu _{2}-H--$ Co moiety.\nResults and Discussion\nPre-Catalyst Synthesis and Initial Evaluation of Countercation\nInfluence\nIn order to systematically examine the influence of different countercations on the catalytic potential, we synthesized a series of bis $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod)cobaltate salts [Cat][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)_{2}] \\space($ Cat=K(thf) $_{0.2}(1),$ Na(thf) $_{1.5}(2),$ Li(thf $)_{2}(3), \\space(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg(4), and $N(^{n}Bu)_{4}(5)$ ; Scheme 1, top). While complexes 1, 3 and 4 were readily obtained via known procedures, $^{[16,17]}$ the sodium salt 2 was prepared from 3 by a cation exchange reaction with $NaO^{t}$ Bu in 34 $\\%$ yield (Scheme 1a). Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) analysis on crystals grown from THF/n-hexane revealed the formation of a solvent-separated ion pair [Na(thf $)_{6}][(Co(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)_{2}] \\space($ Na1-Co1 8.220(7) A; see Figure S31, SI). Substitution of the metal-based cation by reaction of 1 with equimolar $N(^{n}Bu)_{4}$ Cl afforded $[N(^{n}Bu)_{4}]-$ [Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod) $_{2}] \\space(5)$ in 28 $\\%$ yield (Scheme 1b). SC-XRD analysis revealed that complex 5 shows an ion-separated structure (N1--Co1 6.207(1) \\text{\\AA}) similar to 2 in the solid state(Figure S32, SI). A comparative study of the catalytic activities of the cobaltates 1-5 in alkene hydrogenations(2-12 bar $H_{2},30-60 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ Table 1) revealed a clear trend of increasing activity from potassium cobaltate 1 to magnesium cobaltate 4. 1-Octene was hydrogenated quantitatively by the $Li^{+}, \\space Na^{+}$ and $(^{Dep}$ nacnac) $Mg^{+}$ salts 2-4 but to a much lower degree with the $K^{+}$ salt 1 (Table 1, entry 1). The $(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg cobaltate 4 gave the highest conversions in the hydrogenation of tri- and tetra-substituted alkenes\nDep-N\nN-Dep\n1:[K(thf) $_{0},2]^{+}+++ \\\\ 2:[$ Na(ttf) $)_{1.5]+}\\\\ 3:[$ Lithf) $2]^{+}$\n[N(nBu)4]+\n5\na) Preparation of 2:\nNaOtBu\n$\\frac{n-hexane}{\\rightarrow 78 ^\\circ\\text{C} tort,2d}$\n1000\n$Lio^{t}Bu$\n[Li(thf)2]+\n[Na(thf)1.5]+\n3\n2\nb) Preparation of 5:\n$+N(^{n}Bu)_{4}$ Cl $\\frac{THF/PhMe(1:2)}{-30 ^\\circ\\text{C} tort,1.1.5d}\\\\ -$ KC,1.5d\n[K(thf)0.2]+\n[N('Bu)4]+\n1\n5\n(Table 1, entries 3-6), whereas the tetrabutylammonium derivative 5 showed negligible activity (Table 1, entries 1-3). To gain further insight into the reaction course, the hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene was monitored $by^{1}H$ NMR spectroscopy using [K(thf) $_{0.2}][Co(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod) $_{2}] \\space(1)$ and $[(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod) $_{2}] \\space(4)$ as pre-catalysts (10 mol $\\%$. 2 bar $H_{2},$ ambient temperature, Figures S12-13, SI). These experiments confirmed that 4 is the more expedient precatalyst, enabling the complete hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene in <266min. In contrast, pre-catalyst 1 gave 24 $\\%$of cumene after 263 min. It is also important to note that well-resolved NMR spectra with sharp signals are observed until the hydrogenation reaction has ceased. This strongly indicates the absence of (paramagnetic) cobalt particles in the reaction mixtures.\nCatalyst Properties of $[(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod)2](4)\nThese promising findings prompted us to investigate the substrate scope for complex 4. Following the initial screening and control experiments (see the SI), the hydrogenation of different alkenes was tested using 4. A low catalyst loading and mild $H_{2}$ pressure (3 mol $\\%$ 4, 2 bar $H_{2}, \\space 30^{\\circ}C.$ 3 h; Figure 2, Protocol A) sufficed for the hydrogenation of linear a-olefins (e.g. 1-octene, styrene) to tri-substituted olefins (e.g. trans-a-methylstilbene). In terms of functional group tolerance, a-methylstyrene substituted with 4-OMeor 4-F groups did not impede hydrogenation, but 4-Cl and 4Br substituents did. Using a slightly modified protocol(5mol$\\%$4,12 $barH_{2},40 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,22$ h;Figure2,ProtocolB), more challenging tri- and tetra-substituted olefins were successfully hydrogenated. The quantitative hydrogenation of naphthalene to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and the hydrogenation of the $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bond in cyclopropylbenzene highlighted the high activity of pre-catalyst 4. In addition, $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated esters underwent facile hydrogenation with high chemoselectivity for the C=C double bond showcasing an extension to functionalized alkene substrates. Finally, tetra-substituted olefins such as 2,3-dimethyl-1H-indene, 2-methyl-3-phenyl-1H-indene, 1,1,2,2-tetramethylethylene, 1-phenyl-1,2,2-trimethylethylene and even the very sterically hindered 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethylene were hydrogenated in good to excellent yields (61-94 $\\%$).\nCatalyst Topicity\nFurther studies focused on reaction progress analyses and kinetic poisoning experiments to distinguish between a homotopic (single molecular) vs. a heterotopic (multiple aggregated) active site. $^{[18]}$ The investigations focused on complex 4, for which the reaction progress analysis of the hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene (3mol$\\%$,2 bar $H_{2},25 ^\\circ\\text{C})$ showed a short induction period between 30 to 90 s (Figure 3, black curve; see the Supporting Information for further information). Initial ligand exchange with the respective alkene substrate parallel to its hydrogenation can account for the delay in reaction onset. $^{[19,20]}$ This is followed by steady conversion giving >90 $\\%$ hydrogenation product after 10 min. The attempted amalgamation with excess mercury (1690mol$\\%$,563.3 equiv. with respect to 4) at 0 min had only a minor effect on the reaction rate and full conversion was still reached within 20 min (Figure 3, blue curve) $.^{[21]}$ Use of trimethylphosphine ( $PMe_{3},12$ mol$\\%$, 4.0 equiv. with respect to 4) resulted in catalyst inhibition pointing to a homotopic active species (Figure 3, green curve) $.^{[7,22]}$ Afour-fold excess of $PMe_{3}$ is necessary to occupy all the coordination sites at the Co center. $^{[23]}$ Poisoning with dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene(dct,60mol$\\%$,20.0equiv.with\nrespect to 4) resulted in catalyst inhibition (Figure 3, red curve). An excess of dct (10.0 equiv. per coordination site) is needed to suppress the hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene which can be attributed to the concomitant partial hydrogenation of dct. $^{[7]}$ This is supported by the observation that the homoleptic dct complex $[(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ dct) $_{2}]$ (thf) $_{1.7}(6)$ is also active in the hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene but with varying induction periods ranging from 0 to 10 min, while the addition of 60mol$\\%$ dct to 6 suppresses the hydrogenation activity (see the Supporting Information for details) $.^{[24]}$ Further investigation was conducted using protocol B (12 bar $H_{2}$ and $40 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C})$ to examine the potential formation of Co nanoparticles under these conditions. The presence of excess Hg had no impact on the hydrogenation of a,B-unsaturated esters, but varying outcomes were recorded for triphenylethylene (yielding 55-94 $\\%$ of triphenylethane; see Table S4, SI). In this context, it is worth mentioning that an excess of Hg caused complete poisoning of an in situ generated Co nanoparticle catalyst under the same conditions (Table S4, SI) $.^{[25]}$\nIn conclusion, a homotopic hydrogenation mechanism is consistent with these poisoning experiments for 4. However, assessing catalyst topicity is intricate for anionic metalates, and the partial inhibition of the triphenylethylene hydrogenation using protocol B suggests that cobalt particles may contribute to some extent at elevated temperature and pressure.\nModelling Alkene Coordination\nTo model substrate coordination to the cobalt center, the bis $(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene)cobaltate salt $[(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{-}------$ styrene $)_{2}]($ thf) $_{3.5}\\space(7)$ was prepared in 43 $\\%$ yield by reaction of 4 with 4.0 equiv. of styrene in THF (Scheme 2, top). SC-XRD analysis of crystals obtained from THF/n-hexane revealed a solvent-separated ion pair (Mg1-Co1 $7.509(2)\\mathring{A}),$ in which the $(^{Dep}$ nacnac) $Mg^{+}$ cation is coordinatively saturated with three THF molecules. The [(Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene) $_{2}]^{-}$ anion is bound in a distorted tetrahedral fashion to one $\\eta ^{4}-1,5-$ cyclooctadiene and two $\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene ligands (Scheme 2, bottom). Catalytic tests on the hydro-\ngenation of selected alkenes using 7 (Table 2, toluene solvent) demonstrated comparable activity with respect to pre-catalyst 4 for a-methyistyrene (Table 2, Entry 1) and naphthalene (Table 2, Entry 4), while complex 7 was superior for 1,1,2,2-tetramethylethylene (Table 2, Entry 5; 4: 78 $\\%$vs. 6: 98 $\\%$ yield). Thus, complex 7 presumably represents a substrate stabilized form of the active catalytic species.\nCounterion Influence on Hydrogen Uptake\nTo gain further insight on the influence of the countercation on the reaction rate, we monitored the $H_{2}$ uptake for the amethylstyrene hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by complexes 1-4 (3mol$\\%$ pre-catalyst, 2 bar $H_{2}, \\space 25^{\\circ}$ C; Figure 4). The results show that the $(^{Dep}$ nacnac) $Mg^{+}$ salt 4 enabled the quantitative hydrogenation of the alkene substrate within 15 min (Figure 4a), while the $Li^{+}$ salt 3 gave $\\approx 90 \\space $\\%$$ yield after 30 min (Figure 4b). In contrast, the hydrogenation with $K^{+}$ salt 1 and $Na^{+}$ salt 2 gave only 16 $\\%$ and 32 $\\%$ yield. respectively, over a significantly longer time period (2 h)(Figure 4c, d). These observations are consistent with the reactivity trend observed for various other substrates(Table 1, see above). Furthermore, significant catalyst deactivation occurred for 1-3 between 10 and 20 min after the reaction onset, while the initial rate of hydrogenation also appeared to be lower with 1 and 2 than with 3 and 4. These results illustrate the notable influence of the countercation on the catalytic activity. Since the hydrogenation of the cod ligand in the complexes might be a crucial factor contributing to their catalytic activity, the $H_{2}$ uptake of the complexes themselves was also monitored (2 bar $H_{2},25 ^\\circ\\text{C} .$ 1 h; Table 3 and the Supporting Information for further details) by quantifying the formation of cyclooctene and cyclooctane (which emerge from the uptake of one and two equiv. of $H_{2},$ respectively) by GC-FID. The results show increasing $H_{2}$ incorporation by the cobaltate salts in the order $1<2<3 \\approx 4 \\space(1:12 \\space $\\%$ ,2:24 \\space $\\%$ ,3:45 $\\%$ 4:38 $\\%$$ ;Table3, entries 1-4). In contrast, the hydrogenation of tetrabutylammonium cobaltate 5 gave only $1 $\\%$ \\space H_{2}$ incorporation(Table 3, entry 5), which indicates the need of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal counterion for substantial hydrogenation activity. Remarkably, the heteroleptic complex 7 was fully hydrogenated when placed under an atmosphere of $H_{2}$ (Figure S4, SI), which is in line with its superior catalytic activity (see above) and suggests that the monodentate styrene ligand enables pre-catalyst hydrogenation under very mild conditions.\nComputational StudiesTo further understand the effect of the counterion, we performed a combined MM (molecular mechanics) MD simulation and DFT investigation to model the reaction mechanism and the interaction between the catalytically active anion and the cations. To begin, the whole reaction profile for the hydrogenation of styrene starting from anionic [Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene) $_{2}]^{-}(7_{A})$ was calculated at the DFT level $(r^{2}$ SCAN-3c, CPCM[THF]) on the singlet surface and in the absence of any counterion (Scheme 3). Dissociation of one styrene molecule forms the 16 valence electron complex [Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene) $]^{-}(8_{A}),$ which adds $H_{2}$ via oxidative addition $(9_{A}\\rightarrow [10_{A}]^{\\ddagger}\\rightarrow 11_{A}).$ Subsequent migratory insertion of the styrene double bond into the Co--H bond of dihydride complex [Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene $)H_{2}]^{-}\\space(11_{A}\\rightarrow$ $[12_{A}]^{\\ddagger}\\rightarrow 13_{A})$ is found to be the turnover-limiting step (TLS) with an activation barrier of 19.0 kcal/mol and a total energy barrier of 31.2 kcal/mol. The corresponding transition state structure is highly asynchronous with Pauling bond $orders^{[26]}$ BO=0.95 for the Co $-C_{2}$ bond and BO=0.54 for the $C_{l}-H^{a}$ bond (see the structure of $[12_{A}]^{\\ddagger}$ in Figure 5). Coordination of another styrene molecule precedes the reductive elimination of ethylbenzene from [Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene)(H)( $CH_{2}CH_{2}$ which drives the reaction downhill in energy $(\\Delta G=-9.9$ kcal/mol).\nWhile this initial analysis established the elementary steps of the hydrogenation reaction, the anion-only model was not able to provide a reasonable total energy barrier(31.2 kcal/mol) for the hydrogenation of styrene at the experimental temperature of $298 \\space K.^{[27]}$ Thus, we decided to investigate the influence of a metal-based counterion $(M^{+}=$ $K^{+}, \\space Na^{+},$ or $[^{Dep}$ nacnac] $Mg^{+})$ on structures $11_{A}-13_{A}$ in the turnover-limiting migratory insertion step. To adequately model the dynamic behavior of the solvated ion pairs [M(thf) $_{n}][Co(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene $)H_{2}] \\space($ denoted as $: \\space 11_{K}$ , $11_{Na}, \\space 11_{Li}$ and $11_{Mg}),$ force field based MD simulations were performed (see the SI). After initial force field parametrization, the time-dependent structural behavior of the system in a bulk of THF molecules $(n_{THF}\\ge 500)$ was studied and the most-populated ion pair structures were identified. According to the MD simulations, complexes $11_{K}$ to $11_{Mg}$ exhibit short distances between the metal cation and the cobalt anion indicating tight ion pairing.To further characterize the counterion interactions within the migratory insertion step, the obtained geometries were then re-optimized at DFT level $(r^{2}$ SCAN-3c) with explicit solvation in the first coordination sphere of the metal cation to capture solvent screening effects on the ion pair structures and energies. Intimate ion pairs were observed for complexes $11_{K-Mg},$ transition state structures $[12_{K-Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ and insertion products $13_{K-Mg}.$ Figure 5 displays the transition state geometries for the migratory insertion step\nfor the pure anion $[12_{A}]^{\\ddagger}$ and the two potassium and magnesium cobaltate salts [K(thf) $_{5}][Co(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene) $H_{2}]([12_{K}]^{\\ddagger})$ and $[(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg(thf)][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod $)(\\eta ^{2}-$ styrene) $H_{2}]([12_{Mg}]^{*}).$ The ion pairs $[12_{K}]^{\\ddagger}$ and $[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ represent the two reactivity extremes for the alkali and alkaline earth metal cobaltate salts used in the hydrogenation reaction (see above). Direct cation hydride interactions are present in both transition states $[12_{K}]^{\\ddagger}$ and $[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ (and also in $[12_{Na/Li}]^{\\ddagger}),$ while no cation styrene interaction can be observed (see the Supporting Information for the other ion pair structures). An analysis of the NPA charges for the pure anion $[12_{A}]^{\\dagger}$ reveals a weak polarization of the two Co-H bonds with $H^{a}$ exhibiting a slightly protic character whereas $H^{b}$ is weakly hydridic (Figure 5, A and B; and Table 4, Entry A.5). This polarization difference of the $Co-H^{a}/Co-H^{b}$ bond quantified by $\\Delta \\delta$ is already present in the intermediate structure $11_{A}$ (Table 4, Entry A.4: 0.07) and is only slightly increased (to 0.14) in $[12_{A}]^{*}.$ In contrast, a stark increase $\\Delta \\delta$ is observed when a counterion is introduced in $[12_{K-Mg}]^{\\ddagger}\\space(e.g.$ for Mg: Table 4, Entry E.4: 0.16 vs. E.5: 0.64). This can also be seen in the transition state geometries of $[12_{K}]^{\\ddagger}$ and $[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger},$ where $H^{b}$ is directly oriented towards the metal cation thereby inducing a pronounced negative polarization in the Co $-H^{b}$ bond (Figure 5, C and D).\nThe polarization difference $\\Delta \\delta$ in the transition state structures $[12_{K-Mg}]^{\\dagger}$ was most pronounced for the magnesium salt $[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ (Table 4, Entry A.5-E.5). This polarization may facilitate the migratory insertion of the alkene molecule. In addition, a distinct coordination geometry for $[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ in comparison to $[12_{K-Li}]^{\\ddagger}$ was observed. While the alkali metal cobaltate salts exhibit a more central positioning of the cation between the two Co-H bonds (Figure 5C for $[12_{K}]^{\\dagger}).$ $in[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ only the more hydridic $H^{b}$ is in direct proximity to the magnesium cation (Figure 5D). Moreover, the benzyl unit of the styrene molecule is rotated outwards away from magnesium, while the benzyl group is oriented towards the alkali metal cation (Figure 5, C vs. D). Furthermore, a stepwise decrease in transition state energy (and thus total\nenergy barrier) for the migratory insertion step corroborated the beneficial effect of the counterion (Table 4, A.1-E.1). A sequential decrease of the transition state energy in the order $[12_{A}]^{\\ddagger}>[12_{K}]^{\\ddagger}=[12_{Na}]^{\\ddagger}>[12_{Li}]^{\\ddagger}=[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ is observed. which is in qualitative agreement with the observed reactivity trend of complexes 1-4. In order to further examine the [Co $-H^{b}] \\cdots M^{+}$ interaction, we conducted noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on the transition state structures $[12_{K-Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ (Figure 6). The calculations were performed on the fully optimized geometries $(r^{2}$ SCAN-3c) and the electron densities calculated at $\\omega B97M-V/$ def2-QZVP level of theory (see the Supporting Information for all NCI analyses). In all four transition state structures, an attractive interaction between Co $--H^{b}$ and the cation is observed. For $[12_{K}]^{\\ddagger},$ this interaction is indicated by the green isosurface between $H^{b}$ and the potassium cation (Figure 6a) and by the green region in the two-dimensional NCI plot (sign $(\\lambda _{2})\\rho <0$ ; Figure 6b). Along the series of alkali metal cations, the attractive metal-hydride interaction becomes stronger following the trend $: \\space K^{+}<Na^{+}<$ Figure 6c for $[12_{Na}]^{\\ddagger},$ and Figure 6d for $[12_{Li}]^{\\ddagger}).$ For lithium, a fairly strong interaction can be observed which is indicated by the additional blue color in the NCI isosurface and NCI plot cutout (sign $(\\lambda _{2})\\rho \\approx$ -0.3; Figure 6d). The most pronounced attractive interaction was found between Co $--H^{b}$ and the magnesium cation in $[12_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ reaching into the range of strong non-covalent\ninteractions (sign $(\\lambda _{2})\\rho \\approx -0.5$ ; Figure 6e), thereby surpassing the hydride interaction with the alkali metal cations of $[12_{K-Li}]^{\\dagger}.$\nOverall, NCI analysis established an increasing attractive cation-hydride interaction following the trend $: \\space K^{+}<Na^{+}<$ $Li^{+}<Mg^{2+}.$ This trend is in agreement with the stronger bond polarization (Co $-H^{a}$ vs. Co $-H^{b})$ found for the magnesium cobaltate salt, its reduced transition state energy for the turnover-limiting migratory insertion step and its distinct coordination geometry.\nFor completeness, the reductive elimination of styrene $(14 \\rightarrow [15]^{\\dagger})$ was analyzed in the same manner for the $Na^{+}$ and $(^{Dep}$ nacnac) $Mg^{+}$ salts (see the Supporting Information for details). This is the second elementary step to finalize the reduction of the styrene double bond. Even though this step is not turnover-limiting a distinct counterion effect on the transition state energy was observed for the more Lewisacidic $Mg^{2+},$ while the sodium salt exhibited a near-identical reaction barrier $([15_{Na}]^{\\ddagger})$ to the anion-only model. NCI analysis of $[15_{Mg}]^{\\ddagger}$ identified an interaction between the magnesium cation and the $\\eta ^{2}-$ bound styrene molecule, which likely accounts for the reduction in transition state energy. The accumulated computational data corroborates the heightened activity for magnesium cobaltate 4 (and $11_{Mg})$ in the hydrogenation reactions which we observe experimentally.\nConclusion\nThis work shows that countercations have a remarkable effect on alkene hydrogenation reactions catalyzed by anionic cobalt complexes. The investigation of the series of[Cat][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod) $_{2}]$ complexes (Cat=K (1), Na (2), Li (3), $(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg $(4),N(^{n}Bu)_{4}(5))$ revealed that the lithium and magnesium salts are much more powerful catalysts for the hydrogenation of challenging, highly substituted alkene substrates than the potassium and sodium salts. The presence of the non-coordinating tetrabutylammonium cation results in a sharp decrease in hydrogenation activity. $[(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg][Co $(\\eta ^{4}-$ cod) $_{2}] \\space(4)$ showed the highest activity and to our knowledge is among the most active first-row transition metal catalysts for the hydrogenation of tri- and tetra-substituted alkenes. $^{[5b,f,h,i,7]}$ In line with these catalytic investigations, reaction progress analyses and pre-catalyst hydrogenation experiments revealed differing reaction rates for the cobaltate salts 1 to 5. The homotopic nature of the reaction mechanism was supported by poisoning studies. A combined MD and DFT study suggests the coordination of the countercation to the hydride in the turnover limiting migratory insertion step and demonstrates a beneficial, energy-lowering effect in comparison with the anion-only model system. The lowest energy barriers were calculated for M=Li (3) and $M=(^{Dep}$ nacnac)Mg (4). The NCI analyses of the migratory insertion transition state for complexes 1 to 4 illustrate the increasingly attractive interactions of the metal cations with one of the hydrido ligands following the trend $: \\space K^{+}(1)<Na^{+}(2)<$ nacnac) $Mg^{+}(4),$ resulting in stronger Co-H bond polarization. The results of this study show that counterion coordination can strongly modulate reactivity in hydrogenation reactions and possibly other catalytic reactions involving hydride intermediates. Furthermore, the nacnac ligand in 4 should enable the design of new structural motifs, such as asymmetric modifications. Investigations in these directions are ongoing.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr. Gabor Bal'azs for valuable comments on the manuscript.

Chung, and Gojko Lalic*\nAbstract: Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig-type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig-type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper-catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E-selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti-elimination.\nIntroduction\nWittig-type olefination is a powerful synthetic tool that enables the construction of a new carbon-carbon $\\sigma -$ bond with precise control over the geometry of the newly formed $\\pi -$ bond. $^{[1]}$ These features are shared by two state-of-the-art catalytic methods for alkene synthesis: olefin cross- $metathesis^{[2]}$ and the hydroalkylation of alkynes. $^{[3]}$ What makes Wittig-type olefination reactions particularly valuable is that they operate on carbonyls and imines, which are ubiquitous in organic chemistry. Examples of such reactions include Wittig, $^{[1a,c,4]}$ HWE, $^{[5]}$ Peterson, $^{[6]}$ and $Julia^{[7]}$ olefinations, which all follow the general form shown in Scheme 1a.\nThe key intermediate in Wittig-type olefination reactions are carbanions stabilized by an oxo/aza-philic moiety. While exact mechanisms of individual reactions vary, the nucleophilicity of these intermediates generally drives the formation of a new $\\sigma -$ bond in a reaction with a $\\pi -$ electrophile. The oxo/aza-philic group then facilitates the elimination to form the new $\\pi - bond^{[1d,4a]}$ For example, with phosphonium ylides the phosphonium group stabilizes the adjacent negative charge and facilitates alkene formation through elimination of the phosphine oxide.\nIn contrast to the state-of-the-art methods for alkene synthesis, Wittig-type reactions have been conceived as stoichiometric processes. Over time, significant effort has been devoted to the development of catalytic Wittig-type reactions, with a major focus on recovering the anion stabilizing group G (see 2).\nFor example, P(III)/P(V) oxidation state cycling has been leveraged in turning over phosphine oxide and accomplishing phosphine-catalyzed Wittig/HWE reactions. $^{[8]}$ However, this approach does not address the key issue related to ylide synthesis: to access ylides, the anion precursors (1) are prepared from more readily available starting materials and then treated with a full equivalent of a base. As a result, the catalytic Wittig reactions centered on phosphine recycling work with a very narrow range of specialized substrates that facilitate the ylide formation. Efforts to transform other Wittig-type reactions into similar catalytic processes have not been as fruitful. $^{[9]}$ Therefore, stoichiometric forms of Wittig-type reactions remain by far the most common.\nTransition metal catalysis has so far played a relatively minor role in the development of catalytic Wittig-type olefination reactions. $^{[10]}$ In the most common approach to metal-catalyzed Wittig reactions, phosphonium ylides have been accessed through a catalytic reaction of phosphines with diazo $alkanes^{[11]}$ or alkyl $halides^{[12]}$ (Scheme 1b). To be efficient, both reactions require the presence of an additional electron-withdrawing group(EWG) in the ylide precursor. $^{[13]}$ Despite these limitations, these examples have suggested a different approach to developing catalytic variants of Wittig-type reactions, in which metal catalysis enables efficient and convenient access to ylides and ylide-equivalents from readily available starting materials.\nExploring the idea of transition metal catalyzed formation of ylide equivalents, we focused on copper boryl heterobimetallic complex 4. This complex can be accessed directly from alkynes or alkenyl boronate esters through copper hydride catalysis and has been identified as a key intermediate in copper-catalyzed reactions developed by our group and by others (Scheme $1c).^{[3a,14]}$ We recognized that the two reactive sites of this complex make it a functional equivalent of an ylide. As Meek, Cho and Yun groups have demonstrated, the copper boryl complex can react with $\\pi -$ electrophiles to form a new $\\sigma -$ bond. $^{[14c,15]}$ Further, known bora-Wittig reactions rely on the ability of a boryl group to facilitate elimination of oxygen/nitrogen-based functional groups and promote the formation of a new $\\pi -$ bond. $^{[16]}$\nThese unique properties of heterobimetallic complex 4 allowed us to envision the catalytic olefination of $\\pi -$ electro-\na.

In the proposed transformation, the heterobimetallic intermediate is obtained by the reaction of alkenyl boronate ester with copper hydride.\nThe addition of the intermediate to a carbonyl or an imine is followed by elimination to furnish the alkene product. Additionally, transmetalation of the addition product with a hydride donor allows catalyst turnover and the overall transformation to proceed without the need for a stoichiometric amount of a base.\nResults and Discussion\nReaction Development\nWe initiated the development of the proposed olefination reaction by examining a variety of $\\pi -$ electrophiles in a reaction with alkenyl boronic esters, performed in the presence of a copper catalyst and a silane (Scheme 2). Aldehydes produced the desired alkene product in low yield, in part due to the reduction of the carbonyl outcompeting the desired reaction. We explored in situ formation of the aldehyde through the copper hydride mediated reduction of pyridoate esters. Keeping the aldehyde concentration low improved the yield, but the E:Z ratio of the alkene product remained low. In an effort to improve the stereoselectivity of the reaction, we explored imine electrophiles and found that selectivity was heavily influenced by the substituent on the imine nitrogen. $^{[17]}$ Gratifyingly, under the same conditions simple anilinederived imines provided 7 with E:Z ratio greater than 30:1.\nUsing the preliminary results described in Scheme 2 as a starting point, we developed the copper-catalyzed Wittigtype olefination of aryl imines, shown in Table 1.

Replacing the potassium counter ion with sodium (entry 5) or switching to potassium tert-butoxide (entry 6) led to drastically lower selectivity and yield, with full consumption of the starting materials. Similarly, TMDSO and closely related HMTSO (entry 7) were the only silanes that gave good results, where other silanes, such as DMMS (entry 8), predominantly led to hydrosilylation of the alkenyl\n9 (1.5 equiv)\nLigands\nMe Me\nPPh2\nAr\nAr\nPPh2\nXantphos\nPPh2\ndppbz\nIPr:Ar=2,6-(i-Pr) $_{2}C_{6}H_{3}$\nboronate ester. Most ethereal solvents gave good to excellent yields and selectivities (entry 9 and table S9) while aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene (entry 10). gave lower yields. Additionally, we found that a mixture of THF and 2-MeTHF gave the most consistent results throughout our exploration of the substrate scope. The reaction temperature also had a strong effect on the reaction outcome. At lower temperatures we observed diminished yield but increased selectivity, while at higher temperatures (entries 11 and 12) the yield was unchanged. and selectivity was lower. Finally, in the absence of the copper precatalyst, ligand, silane or base, we did not observe any of the desired alkene product (entry 13).\nWhile alkenyl boronate esters are straightforward to synthesize and are generally stable, we wanted to explore if alkynes could be used as starting materials for the reaction in a one-pot procedure. As shown in equation 1, an alkyne(11) can be transformed to an alkenyl boronate ester, which is then used in the olefination reaction without isolation under standard reaction conditions (see Table $1).^{[19]}$ The yield and diastereoselectivity of the desired styrene are comparable to those obtained using an alkenyl boronate ester as the starting material.\n$\\overset{HBCy_{2}(5mo| $\\%$)}{\\xrightarrow{HBpin(1.5 \\space equiv)}}{THF,25 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,24h}$$\\frac{9}{\\text{standard}}\\\\$ conditions 78$\\%$ yield\\\\(42:1)\n7(eq.1)\nPh\n11\nnot isolated\nSubstrate Scope\nAfter establishing reaction conditions that provided excellent yield and E-selectivity of the model substrate, we explored the scope of our olefination reaction (Scheme 3). We found that a variety of functional groups could be tolerated on the alkenyl boronate ester, including terminal alkenes (12), both aryl nucleophiles and electrophiles (13 and 14), a protected allylic alcohol (15) and a Boc-protected amine (17), as well as nitrogen-containing heterocycles (16 and 21). The reaction was also amenable to simple vinyl boronate esters (20) and $\\beta -$ styrenyl boronate esters (19), although with slightly diminished yield, likely due to the altered electronic properties of the starting $\\pi -$ bond.\nWe next turned our attention to the aryl imine scope and found that our reaction tolerates a variety of ortho, meta and para substituents (26,22,23,and 28). In addition, several nitrogen-containing heterocycles are tolerated (24 and 27). Further, conjugated imines provide 1,3-dienes in good yield(29). We found that under our standard reaction conditions, electron deficient aryl imines were readily reduced and did not produce the desired styrene products. However, using imines derived from more electron-rich anilines and a less electron-donating ligand, we were able to realize the transformation of m-cyano and p-trifluoromethyl aryl imines into the corresponding styrenes (25 and 31). We believe that the successful formation of these two products can be attributed to the decreased reduction of the starting imines and slower copper-catalyzed isomerization of the styrene $\\pi -$ bond under the modified reaction conditions.\nFurther, we found that our method could be applied to the synthesis of alkenes with quaternary carbons at the allylic position. These highly sterically encumbered alkenes are not only a challenge to synthesize using catalytic methods but are also formed in low yields using stoichiometric Wittig-type reactions. $^{[20]}$ By changing the hydride source and increasing the temperature to $60 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ we were able to produce alkenes showcasing a variety of substitution patterns and excellent selectivity (>200:1 selectivity). A simple tert-butyl group (32), as well as various cyclic and fused ring systems were tolerated (35 and 36). A cyclopropyl moiety (37), a simple methyl ester (39) and a tetrahydrofuran (34) were all tolerated under the reaction conditions. Curiously, when 74 and 71 were submitted to the reaction conditions, we did not observe the expected a-phenyl ether and a-methoxy ester alkenes, but instead we isolated the products arising from rearrangement prior to elimination(see Supporting Information for more details).\nWe also identified some general limitations of the reaction (see Scheme 3, bottom). More highly substituted alkenyl boronate esters featuring trisubstituted alkenes did not provide significant amount of the desired products, and\ninstead led to the reduction of an imine. The presence of good leaving groups, such as tosylates, also prevented the formation of the desired alkene. Alkyl imines containing ahydrogen atoms gave less than 10 $\\%$ yield of the desired aliphatic alkene product under a variety of reaction conditions. Similarly, imines derived from ketones or alkynyl aldehydes gave a complex mixture of products under the standard reaction conditions, as did ethyl N(phenyl)formimidate.\nReaction Mechanism\nTo better understand the mechanism of this reaction we performed several mechanistic experiments. Our first goal was to confirm the proposed role of a copper containing heterobimetallic complex as the intermediate in the reaction. Although phosphine-ligated 1,1-boryl-copper heterobimetallic complexes have been proposed as catalytic intermediates before, they have only been characterized via $^{31}P$ NMR analysis. $^{[14e]}$ To gain a stronger and more specific\nconfirmation for the involvement of the phosphine ligated heterobimetallic intermediate, we used a $^{13}C-$ enriched alkenyl boronate ester (41) as a substrate (Scheme 4). Submitting 41 to a solution of dppbzCuH gave rise to a new\ndg-THF, $45 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,1h$\n$45 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,22k$\n$O=^{13}C, \\space 5=128.6$ ppm\ndipp\nPh2P\nBn\nBn\ncu\nPh2\ndipp\nBpin\nBpin\n42, in-situ $\\\\ O=13C, \\space \\delta =17.8$ ppm\n44, isoated $O=13C, \\space \\delta =16.4$ ppm\nbroad signal in $the^{13}C$ NMR spectrum at $\\delta =17.8$ ppm. The addition of imine 9 to this solution produced styrene 43, along with disappearance of the broad signals corresponding to both the starting alkenyl boronate ester and the proposed intermediate (42).\nWhile we were unable to isolate the dppbz-ligated intermediate due to facile decomposition, a related known heterobimetallic species bearing an NHC ligand (44) was isolated and showed a broad signal $in^{13}C$ NMR spectrum at $\\delta =16.4$ ppm corresponding to the a-carbon, further validating our assignment of the phosphine ligated a-boryl alkyl copper species. $^{[14a,d,e,g]}$\nNext, we monitored the reaction of alkenyl Bpin 6 and aryl imine 9 $by^{1}H$ NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 5a). Within 30 minutes we observed consumption of starting material accompanied by the formation of two diastereoisomers of 1,2-boryl amine addition product 45. As the reaction progressed, one isomer appeared to gradually give rise to the product styrene and was fully consumed after 24 hours,\nwhile the other isomer accumulated to a constant concentration. Through careful isolation, conversion to the corresponding oxazolidinone (46), and NOESY and J-coupling analysis (Scheme 5b), we determined that the accumulated adduct was the threo diastereoisomer. The threo isomer of 45 appears not to eliminate under the reaction conditions, suggesting that the product is formed solely via the erythro isomer. In the reaction with alkyl imines, we observed the formation of a single 1,2-boryl amine diastereoisomer that was fully consumed after 48 hours (Scheme 5c). Through similar analysis $using^{1}H$ NMR spectroscopy we identified this isomer as the erythro diastereoisomer.\nTogether, these findings indicate that the erythro diastereoisomer of the addition intermediates gives rise to both the E-styrenes and E-aliphatic alkenes. Therefore, in both cases, the alkene formation involves anti-elimination, $^{[16a]}$ with no indication that the syn-elimination from the erythro isomer occurs. Furthermore, the threo isomer, when formed, does not undergo elimination under the reaction conditions(Scheme 5d). We can speculate about explanations for the observations we made. First, it is likely that the increased bulk of the tert-butyl group prevents the formation of the syn-diastereoisomer in the initial addition to the alkyl imines. Second, the erythro isomer of the addition product, in both reactions of alkyl and aryl imines, encounters the least steric hinderance undergoing anti-elimination, while the aryl threo isomer must overcome increased steric hinderance in either syn- or anti-elimination.\nInterestingly, the understanding of the stereochemistry of the addition and the elimination processes provided unexpectedly little insight into the origin of the Z-alkene products and therefore the E:Z selectivity. The first clue about the origins of the Z-isomer in the reactions of aryl imines came from the observation that the E:Z ratio diminishes during the reaction, suggesting isomerization of the styrene products.\nPreviously, copper hydride has been implicated in the isomerization of styrenes via hydrocupration and subsequent $\\beta -$ hydride elimination. $^{[21]}$ As expected, when we submitted an E-styrene 7 to the standard reaction conditions, we observed an erosion in the E:Z ratio from >100:1 to 43:1(Scheme 5e). We also found that copper hydride mediated isomerization was not as facile in the presence of starting materials.\nOverall, we conclude that E-styrene is formed with high selectivity in the elimination reaction and is then slowly isomerized in the process mediated by the copper catalyst. This conclusion is consistent with the observed dependence of E:Z selectivity on the electronics of the product styrene. We also noticed that for high selectivity, styrenes bearing electron-withdrawing groups required a more electron deficient copper catalyst, presumably to slow the reversible hydrometallation and isomerization.\nIn analogous experiments with aliphatic alkene 32 we found no evidence for its isomerization under the reaction conditions (see Supporting Information). This observation suggests that aliphatic alkene products do not undergo hydrocupration under the reaction conditions and is consis-\ntent with high E-selectivity observed in reactions of aliphatic imines.\nWe found that the starting alkenyl boronate esters also undergo isomerization under the reaction conditions (Scheme 5f). When Z-enriched alkenyl boronate ester 6 was allowed to react under the standard conditions, we observed the erosion of the diastereomeric ratio from (1:172) to (1:6) before full consumption and formation of the product alkene. This result shows that the initial hydrocupration event is likely reversible.\nOn the basis of these experiments, we propose that the reaction proceeds according to the mechanism outlined in Scheme 6. The first step involves the reversible hydrocupration of an alkenyl boronate ester to form the key heterobimetallic intermediate. $^{[14a,22]}$ Subsequently, this intermediate reacts with the imine electrophile, followed by regeneration of copper hydride via an equivalent of silane. $^{[23]}$ The resulting 1,2-boryl N-silylamine eliminates, possibly aided by the Lewis-basic potassium pyridoate, to furnish the E-alkene product, which when $R^{1}$ is aryl can isomerize to give a mixture of E/Z styrenes.\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have developed a new method for the catalytic olefination of imines leveraging a catalytically generated copper-boryl heterobimetallic intermediate as an ylide equivalent. The new reaction is compatible with aryl and sterically hindered alkyl imines and can be performed in the presence of an array of functional groups. Mechanistic studies corroborate the proposed catalytic cycle, confirming the existence and function of the proposed heterobimetallic intermediate, and provide insights into the origins of selectivity of the newly formed $\\pi -$ bond.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge NIH for funding (1R01GM132200-01) and instrument support (S10 OD030224-01A1).\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nKeywords: Alkenes .

This work describes experimental and computational studies to better understand the features of aziridinium ylides as intermediates for the synthesis of highly substituted dehydromorpholines. The development of this chemistry has enabled the extension of aziridinium ylide chemistry to the concomitant formation of both a C-N and C-O bond in a manner that preserves stereochemical information embedded in the substrate. Additionally, we have uncovered several key insights that describe the importance of steric effects , rotational barriers around the C-N bond of the aziridinium ylide , and noncovalent interactions on the ultimate reaction outcome. These critical insights will assist in the development of this chemistry to generate N-heterocycles that will further expand the complex amine chemical space. KEYWORDS: aziridine, aziridinium ylide, carbene, morpholine, tunability, noncovalent interactions\nINTRODUCTION\nOnium ylides, $^{1-5}$ including sulfur, $^{6a-d}$ oxonium, and ammonium, are common intermediates employed in the syntheses of complex molecules. They are typically generated from the reaction of a heteroatom with a metal-supported carbene to furnish reactive zwitterionic intermediates that engage in a diverse set of reaction pathways, including 1,2Stevens rearrangements, $^{8b}2,3-$ sigmatropic rearrangements, and N-H insertion reactions (Scheme $1A).^{3}$ The aziridinium $ylides^{10}$ represent a unique subclass of ammonium ylides whose reactivity is both poorly understood and underexplored, despite the potential for these reactive species to serve as key intermediates in the transformation of simple precursors to densely functionalized, stereochemically rich N-heterocycles. We are interested in applying the ability to shuttle aziridinium ylides along divergent pathways to explore the diverse new amine chemical space, particularly in the context of using our new methods for the preparation of DNA-encoded libraries(DEL) to explore their potential bioactivity.11a-c\nManipulating the reactivity of aziridinium ylides to achieve a desired reaction outcome can be challenging as compared to their acyclic ammonium counterparts. Aziridinium ylides are embedded in a highly strained ring, where the bonding constraints of the aziridine increase the energy required for pyramidal inversion of the nitrogen; often, this rate is slow enough to measure using variable-temperature (VT) or dynamic NMR spectroscopy. $^{12a-c}$ The presence of two invertomers hinders the ability to selectively form and engage aziridinium ylides in secondary reactions and has limited their applications in the synthesis of complex N-heterocycles. For example, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, Clark et al. $^{13}$ and $Rowlands^{14}$ observed intramolecular [2,3]-Stevens rearrangements of aziridinium ylides to deliver dehydropiperidines in low 21-24$\\%$ yields (Scheme 1B). In the former case, the low yield was attributed to the instability of the starting material, which decomposed in one day when stored under argon at $-30^{\\circ}C.^{13}$ In Rowlands' work, the alkyl aziridine substrate existed as two N-invertomers a and b in a ratio of 3:4, with an estimated barrier to N-inversion at room temperature of $\\sim 16-$ 20 kcal/mol. Only a possessed the required geometry for the desired rearrangement; as a result, the major invertomer b underwent an unproductive 1,5-hydride shift at a faster rate than N-inversion to generate the invertomer required for the desired reactivity.14 In addition to the formation of invertomers of the aziridinium ylide, competitive cheletropic extrusion renders the use of these intermediates in selective transformations particularly challenging.15\nWe used rigid bicyclic aziridines (Scheme 1C), generated by silver-catalyzed nitrene transfer of homoallenic and homoallylic\nACS Publications\n1572\ncarbamates, as precursors to aziridinium ylides. $^{16a-c}$ The nitrogen of the carbamate tether in the bicyclic aziridine possesses a hybridization of $\\sim sp^{3},$ where the nitrogen lone pair is unable to engage in effective orbital overlap with the $\\pi$ system of the carbonyl group. As a result, the carbamate behaves as a $\\sigma -$ electron-withdrawing group and raises the barrier to N-pyramidal inversion.17 The geometric constraint imposed by the bicyclic nature of the tether also raises the nitrogen inversion barrier;17 a similar effect is observed in rigid cyclic amines such as sparteine and Tr\"oger's base. $^{18a,18,19a,b}$ Both of these unique structural characteristics can be exploited to generate diastereomerically enriched aziridinium ylides that ultimately furnish highly substituted $methyleneazetidines^{20a,b}$ and $dehydropiperidines^{21}$ in an excellent yield and dr (Scheme 1C). This strategy effectively circumvents competing pathways that have been proposed in previous attempts to leverage the reactivity of aziridinium ylides. However, despite this progress, the future development of productive chemistry of aziridinium ylides requires a more detailed understanding of how the identity of the carbene precursor, potential dynamic behavior in the ylide intermediate, and noncovalent interactions influence the ultimate outcome of the reaction. In this work, we describe our mechanistic findings to explain divergent reaction pathways from aziridinium ylides generated by\n1573\nleveraging ketone-containing carbenes, derived from Rh catalysis, to furnish fully substituted dehydromorpholines(Scheme $1D).^{22-24}$ Both experimental and computational studies are presented that will inform future efforts of our and other groups' work on these fascinating and versatile reactive species.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nInitial Explorations of Diverse Carbene Precursors. We first investigated whether the carbonyl oxygen of an acceptor diazoketone, such as 2a, could serve as a competent nucleophile to open the aziridinium ylide en route to a dehydromorpholine (Scheme 2A). Only one nucleophilic ketone group is present in 2a; thus, we expected the reaction of 2a with i to furnish 4a in a good yiel $\\dot{\\space}$ via the conformer INT1. Surprisingly, treatment of 1 with 2a under $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}$ catalysis gave an unusual [3,9]-aziridine product 3a in a 78$\\%$yield. Presumably, the 7 kcal/mol barrier to interconversion of aziridinium ylide INT1 to INT2 by rotation around the C-N bond (Scheme 2) enables nucleophilic attack of the ketone oxygen on the electrophilic carbonyl of the carbamate tether to furnish 3a. This result was unexpected, as nucleophilic addition to the carbamate tether was not observed in previous syntheses of azetidines or dehydropiperidines from bicyclic aziridine20a,20,21\nWe were curious as to the origin of 3a and hypothesized that the aryl group may be important in biasing the reaction toward this unexpected product. However, exchanging the Ph group of 2a to a Me group in 2b still furnished 3b in an excellent 98$\\%$yield (Scheme 2B). Altering the electronics of $R^{2}$ had no effect on product selectivity. Both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents (e.g, CN in 2c and Me in 2d) furnished [3,9]-aziridine in 75 (3d) and 68$\\%$ (3c) yields, respectively (Scheme 2B). The consistent product outcome suggested that neither $R^{1}$ nor $R^{2}$ influences the preferred formation of the [3,9]-aziridine product.\nTo gain more insight into the formation of 3a at the expense of the expected 4a, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the dispersion-corrected SMD( $CH_{2}Cl_{2})-B3$ LYP-D3/def2-SVP level (see computational details in the Supporting Information). Figure 1A shows the computed reaction profiles leading to the formation of 3a or 4a from the corresponding free aziridinium ylides, which according to our previous calculations on related $systems^{20b,21}$ derives from the nucleophilic addition of the aziridine 2a to the $Rh_{2}-$ carbenoid intermediate (formed upon the reaction of the diazo compound and $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}).$ From the data in Figure 1A, it becomes apparent that the metal-free ylide INT2 involved in the [3,9]-pathway is lower in energy than its analogous intermediate INT1 involved in the alternative [6,6]-pathway $(\\Delta \\Delta G \\space = \\space -4.2$ kcal/mol). A similar finding was observed in their metal-ylide counterparts $(\\Delta \\Delta G \\space = \\space -5.7$ kcal/mol). According to the NCIPLOT method, this is in part ascribed to the occurrence of a stabilizing NCI involving the nucleophilic C-O lone pair of the ketone moiety and the electrophilic $\\pi *(C=O)$ molecular orbital of the carbamate, as confirmed for INT2 (Figure 1B; see also Figure S-14 in the Supporting Information for the metal-ylide intermediate INT2-Rh). The presence of this stabilizing NCI is also supported by the computed short O...C(=O) distance in INT2 of 2.530 A, which is markedly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.22 A); this was also confirmed by the associated stabilization energy $(\\Delta E^{2}\\space = \\space -6.63$ kcal/mol) computed for the lone pair (LP) $(O)\\rightarrow \\pi ^{*}(C=O)$ interaction using the second-order perturbation theory (SOPT) of the NBO method (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the barrier associated with the formation of 3a from INT2 is 5.3 kcal/mol lower than that associated with the formation of 4a from INT1 (Figure 1A). This noticeable difference in the calculated activation energies for the two potential reaction pathways and the occurrence of the NCIs, which show significant stabilization of the key ylide intermediate, lead to the preferred formation of 3a over 4a, despite the fact that the latter species is significantly favored thermodynamically. The barrier to interconversion between INT1 and INT2 (7.6 kcal/mol, Figure 1A) is reinforced by the lower barrier $(\\Delta G^{\\neq}\\space = \\space 1.5$ kcal/mol) computed for the generation of the observed product 3a.\n1574\nA.Control over the intermediate aziridinium ylide\nCN\nCN\nCN\nPr\nPh\nNC\n3mol$\\%$\\\\R $h_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}$\n$\\begin{matrix}3mol $\\%$ \\\\ Rh_{2}(OAC)_{4}\\end{matrix}$\nPh\n2c\n=0\n0\n1,2-DCE, $83 ^\\circ\\text{C}$\n$\\xrightarrow [CH_{2}Cl_{2,40 ^\\circ\\text{C}}]{}$\nEt\"\nEt\nEt\nEt...\n45$\\%$a,b 5c\n50$\\%$(47$\\%$)a,b 4c\n$68 $\\%$ ^{c}3c$\n$19 $\\%$ Standard reaction conditions furnished 3c in a 68$\\%$ yield (by NMR), accompanied by 19$\\%$ of the dehydromorpholine 4c(Scheme 3A, right). The 3.6:1 ratio of 3c:4c led us to employ computations to probe whether an NCI was also present in the corresponding aziridinium ylide and to estimate the barrier to C-N bond rotation. Computational analysis confirmed the presence of an NCI, where the O...C(=O) distance of INT4 is predicted to be 2.619 A (Scheme 3B compared to 2.530 A, Figure 1B), with a stabilizing interaction energy of $\\Delta E^{2}=$ -4.44 kcal/mol. The balance between the computed barrier to C-N bond rotation between INT3 and INT4 of 12.5 kcal/mol and the presence of an NCI lead to a divergent reaction where both 3c and 4c are accessible. These computational observations are reflected in the calculated reaction profile(Scheme 3B), where both the activation energy barriers leading to 3c and 4c are accessible $(\\Delta G \\neq$ of $\\sim 8.5$ kcal/mol) but slightly higher than that of 3a(Figure 1, see above). The higher barrier to C-N bond rotation (compared to the analogous ylide INT2) is likely a result of charge delocalization across the CN group (as compared to the ketone in INT2); nonetheless, it is still low enough to ultimately give rise to the product distribution based on temperature.\nThe computed reaction profile depicted in Scheme 3C also shows that the NCI-stabilized ylide INT4 can undergo a cheletropic extrusion reaction to form the alkene 5c. We hypothesized that running the reaction at higher temperatures would (i) enable facile bond rotation and lead to a greater preference for 4c over the [3,9]-aziridine product 3c and (ii)\n1575\nallow access to the cheletropic extrusion product. To our delight, repeating this reaction at $83 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ in 1,2-dichloroethane(Scheme 3A, left) favored dehydromorpholine 4c formation in a 50$\\%$ yield $by^{1}H$ NMR (47$\\%$ isolated), with the remaining mass balance (45$\\%$ yield) accounted for by formation of 5c; no[3,9]-aziridine 3c formation was observed. Although full selectivity for 4c would be optimal, this reaction represents the first example where the fate of the aziridinium ylide can be controlled by the reaction conditions and not just the identity of the carbene precursor.\nEmploying higher temperatures with other cyano-derived diazoketones also proved fruitful (Scheme 3C). Ketones bearing ortho-, meta-, and para-chlorosubstituted benzenes yielded dehydromorpholines 6c-8c in moderate yields and excellent dr of >20:1. Ketones with meta- and paramethoxysubstituted benzenes were tolerated to furnish dehydromorpholines 10c and 11c in 43 and 29$\\%$ yields, respectively. The ortho-substituted 9c was not observed under these conditions, possibly due to steric congestion around the reactive site that prevents effective ylide formation.\nBased on our computational analysis of [3,9]-aziridine formation in Figure 1A, strategies to prohibit NCI formation in the key ylide intermediate were envisaged to promote formation of the desired dehydromorpholines. We hypothesized that increasing the barrier to C-N bond rotation in the aziridinium ylide intermediate could \"trap\" the kinetically formed conformer(s) and prevent formation of the NCI, potentially favoring a conformer similar to INT1 (Scheme 1A). To this end, the barriers for C-N bond rotation in aziridinium ylides generated from the reaction of 1 with carbene precursors 2a and 2d-f were calculated and compared (Figure 2). The results suggest that aziridinium ylides arising from the reaction of 1 with 2a (which experimentally gave [3,9]-aziridines 3a, Scheme 1B) display a low barrier of ca. 7 kcal/mol to rotation\nabout the C-N bond (black line). The reaction of 1 with 2d revealed a higher barrier of 12 kcal/mol(green line) for C-N bond rotation. In contrast, aziridinium ylides formed from the reaction of 1 with dicarbonyl-containing diazo compounds 2e and 2f show significantly higher barriers to rotation around the C-N bond at $\\sim 23$ (red line) and 20 kcal/mol (blue line), respectively. The increased rotational barrier may be attributed to the ability of the enolate of the ylide to be delocalized over both carbonyl-containing groups, providing additional structural rigidity and steric bulk that hinders C-N bond rotation.\nTo test this hypothesis, aziridine 1 was treated with methylacetoacetate-derived 2e and catalytic $Rh_{2}$ (OAc) $_{4}$ under optimized conditions (Scheme 4A, see the Supporting Information for details). The dehydromorpholine 4e was obtained in a 38$\\%$ yield (48$\\%$ by NMR), accompanied by the corresponding cheletropic extrusion product 5e (42$\\%$ by NMR). Interestingly, no competing[3,9]-aziridine 3e was observed in the crude mixture. Computational analysis of this reaction (Scheme 4B,D) revealed that the O...C(=O) distance is much longer for INT6(3.085 A) than for INT1(2.530 A), a distance close to the limit of the sum of the van der Waals radii(3.22 A). The longer distance is presumably required to accommodate the second C=O from the acceptor-acceptor carbene. This is reflected in the low computed stabilization energy $(\\Delta E^{2}$ (LP $(O)\\rightarrow \\pi ^{*}(C=O))=$ -0.50 kcal/mol), which can be considered negligible. This effectively prevents formation of the undesired NCI; as a result, INT6 and INTS are nearly degenerate $(\\Delta \\Delta G$ of $\\sim 1$ kcal/mol), a markedly different scenario from that involving INT1/INT2 ylides (Figure 1A, see above). Although these computational data present a reasonable scenario for the 1:1 product mixture, we were puzzled why no 3e was observed, considering that the predicted energy barrier is only 5.3 kcal/mol compared to 15.6 kcal/mol for Se (Scheme 4D). A variety of potential pathways were considered. One possibility invoked a retro-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 4e to give 5e; however, re-exposing 4e under the standard reaction conditions(Scheme 4C) gave only recovered 4e. Alternatively, 5e might arise from a retro-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of a product formed by the attack of the ester carbonyl on the aziridinium ylide by delocalization of the negative charge in INT6. However, computational analysis argues against this pathway, as it shows an energy barrier of 18.9 kcal/mol (see Figure S15 in the Supporting Information).\nTo experimentally investigate the origin of 5e, NMR time course data were collected to identify long-lived reaction intermediates or other products not observed in the final crude mixture. The data (Figure 3) showed a consistent increase in the product 4e over the 4 h reaction period. Interestingly, a small amount of 3e was noted, which increased from 1 to 2 h and then decreased from 2 to 4 h, at which time the cheletropic extrusion product 5e was observed. The 2 h reaction aliquot was further analyzed by 1D TOCSY (see Figure S9 in the Supporting Information), which revealed a unique spin system corresponding to 3e. These data are the first experimental evidence supporting the conclusion that the reaction is under thermodynamic control (see above), where the[3,9]-aziridine 3e gives rise to 5e. This result is further supported by the computational data, which show that the formation of 3e from INT-6 is reversible in view of the low computed reaction and barrier energies (1.6 and 8.0 kcal/mol, respectively, see Scheme 4D).\n1576\nOur combined computational and experimental evidence suggests that divergent reactivity to give a $\\sim 1:1$ mixture of 4e and 5e is due to the non-Curtin-Hammett kinetic formation of aziridinium ylide conformers INT5 and INT6 (Scheme 4A). INT5 contains a syn-relationship between the enolate of the methyl ketone and the external aziridine C-N bond, which represents the correct geometry for dehydromorpholine formation. The other potential aziridinium ylide INT6 does not display the correct orientation and thus initially forms 3e, which is ultimately converted to 5e.\nOur attempts to use nonsymmetric acceptor-acceptor diazo carbene precursors to form dehydromorpholines highlighted the importance of steric effects, rotational barriers around the C-N bond of the aziridinium ylide, and NCIs in determining the reaction outcome. Symmetric diketone-containing carbene precursors, such as 2f (Scheme 5A), mitigated these complications by yielding only a single ylide intermediate that engages in nucleophilic ring opening of the aziridinium ylide to form the dehydromorpholine. A series of cissubstituted aziridines bearing linear alkyl chains, including a primary alkyl chloride, furnished 4f and 12f-14f as the sole products in moderate yields and high dr of >20:1. Isopropylsubstituted aziridine 14 was tolerated to furnish 14f, albeit in a moderate yield, indicating the sensitivity of the reaction to steric effects. Small amounts of the cheletropic extrusion product $(\\sim 8 $\\%$)$ were also observed in reactions of branched aziridines. Enantioenriched benzyl-substituted aziridine (S,R)15, obtained in 94$\\%$ ee, was subjected to the reaction conditions; the product 15f was obtained in a 39$\\%$ yield and an excellent>20:1 dr. Importantly, the 97$\\%$ ee of 15f (Scheme 5B)highlighted our ability to effectively transfer stereochemical information from the aziridine into the products to\n1577\nfurnish enantioenriched N-heterocycles. This experimental result also excludes the possibility of a [4+2] hetero-DielsAlder reaction being the operative mechanism that leads to the dehydromorpholine products 4f and 12f-15f (Scheme 5A,B).\nThis chemistry was not restricted to aziridines bearing a 6membered bicyclic tether; a[3,5]-bicyclic aziridine 17 was capable of yielding the substituted dehydromorpholine 18(Scheme 5C). A nice feature of this chemistry was the ability to carry out the reaction in a telescoped fashion directly from the preoxidized nitrene precursor 16 to deliver 18 in a 47$\\%$yield and >20:1 dr over both the aziridination and the ring expansion steps. Expansion of the telescoped reaction to more sterically demanding symmetric and unsymmetric carbene precursors with 1 proved challenging, highlighting the sensitivity of this transformation to sterics (see the Supporting Information for further details). Efforts are ongoing to address this limitation.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a new method for the synthesis of highly substituted dehydromorpholines through the intermediacy of aziridinium ylides. The development of this chemistry has enabled the extension of aziridinium ylide chemistry to the concomitant formation of both a C-N and a C-O bond in a manner that preserves stereochemical information embedded in the substrate aziridine. In addition, we have uncovered several key insights that describe the importance of steric effects, rotational barriers around the CN bond of the aziridinium ylide, and NCIs on the ultimate reaction outcome. These critical insights will assist in the further development of this chemistry to generate novel and complex N-heterocycles that will further expand the complex amine chemical space.\n1578\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\nsi Supporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.1c05413.\nExperimental procedures, computational details, and characterization data for all new compounds (PDF)\nX-ray crystallographic information for 3a (CDCC Deposition Number 2124058) and 4e (2124059)(CIF)(CIF)\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Authors\nIsrael Fern'andez-Departamento de Quimica Organica I and Centro de Innovacion en Quimica Avanzada (ORFEOCINQA), Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid 28040, Spain; iD orcid.org/0000-0002-0186-9774; Email: israel@quim.ucm.es\nJennifer M.

Commun., 2023, 59,5733\nReceived 29th March 2023,\nAccepted 17th April 2023 DOI:10.1039/d3cc01529g\nrsc.li/chemcomm\nJungtaek Kang, Heyjin Cho and Hyunwoo Kim iD *\nThe direct synthesis of sterically hindered aldehydes is highly challenging. Herein, we report a direct approach to generate such compounds via electroreductive cleavage of the C( $sp^{3})-O$ bond of activated alcohols. Under the established reaction conditions, benzylic radical intermediates were efficiently generated. A subsequent radical-polar crossover generated carbanions that further reacted with N,N-dimethylformamide to form various aldehydes with tertiary or quaternary benzylic carbon centers. The feasibility of a gram-scale synthesis was also demonstrated. This reaction is also operated in a simple undivided cell, which avoids the use of any transition metal catalysts, toxic gas, and reductants.\nAldehydes are among the most important synthetic building blocks in pharmaceutical, fine chemical, and industrial processes. $^{1}$ Out of various available synthetic methods, the addition of CO and $H_{2}$ to alkenes, known as hydroformylation, is industrially utilized as a highly atom-economic and efficient reaction to produce more than 10 million tons of oxo alcohols annually. Industrial hydroformylation mostly utilizes 1-alkenes, with propene contributing to approximately 50$\\%$. However, this reaction exhibits limited substrate scope to monosubstituted and 1,1'-or 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, mainly because of the inherent reactivity of Rh or Co catalysts, while the direct hydroformylation of tri- or tetra-substituted alkenes remains a major challenge (Scheme $1A).^{2}$ Accordingly, aldehydes are formed, whose formyl functionality can only be attached to the primary and secondary carbon centers. Therefore, developing efficient synthetic methods for producing substituted aldehydes is urgently required.\nIn recent years, electrosynthesis has emerged as a versatile and promising synthetic method. $^{3}$ In 2020, Lin et al. reported a regioselective carboformylation reaction under electroreductive conditions (Scheme $1B).^{4}$ Electroreductive formylation occurs between an alkyl( $sp^{3})$ carbanion and N,N-dimethylformamide(DMF) without any transition metals. Radical-polar crossover(RPC) of a relatively stable benzyl radical generated via alkyl radical addition to styrene was proposed. However, this procedure was not applicable to $\\beta -$ substituted styrenes, resulting in undesired dimerization owing to the slow kinetics of allyl radical addition. $^{5}$ Moreover, the reaction scope mainly covered the preparation of aldehydes attached to secondary benzylic carbon centers.\nTo expand the scope of aldehydes, we envisioned an alternative electroreductive formylation based on a new activation strategy. Alcohols are stable, inexpensive, naturally abundant, and readily prepared. They have been used as sources of alkyl radicals to form new C-C bonds. $^{6}$ Inspired by seminal works on reductive alcohol activation, 7 we attempted a formylation reaction using alcohols via electroreductive activation.\nHerein, we developed an electroreductive formylation via C( $sp^{3})-O$ bond cleavage (Scheme 1C). Benzyl alcohol derivatives can then be transformed into substituted aldehydes. The unique radical stability of sterically hindered alkyl( $sp^{3})$ radicals enables the reductive RPC reaction. This method provides a wide range of aldehydes, which are otherwise challenging to be synthesized.\nWe set out to investigate the electroreductive formylation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl acetate 1 (Table 1). Notably, this compound has not been previously used in electrosynthesis. $^{4}$ Our initial experiments revealed that the electrolysis of 1 using 1.1 equiv. of LiOTf as the electrolyte, DMF as a solvent and formyl group donor, and a Mg plate as sacrificial anode led to the formation of the desired formylated product 2, in 46$\\%$ yield, as determined $by^{1}H$ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Table 1, entry 1). Changing the leaving group to benzoate provided a product with a slightly reduced yield (entry 2). The reaction products were found to be highly dependent on the electronic character of the benzoate (entries 3 and 4), suggesting a role for the C-O bond in the radical processes. Changing the salt to $KPF_{6}$ significantly hampered the reaction (entry 5). During the experiment, a cell voltage that was too high (>12 V) was observed when using the constant current mode of the DC supply. This might be due to the passivation of the surface of the Mg anode, which ceased proper electrolysis. $^{8}$ Changing the cathode from\nLiOTf(1.1 equiv.),DMF(5mL)\nMg(+)|C(-),undivided cell/=8mA,3.2F/mol, $25 ^\\circ\\text{C}$\nR=Me\\\\1\n2\n$^{a}$ Reaction conditions: undivided cell, Mg anode, carbon felt cathode, 1(1mmol), LiOTf (1.1 equiv.), DMF (5 mL), constant current (8 mA), 10.8 h(3.2 F $mol^{-i}). \\space ^{b}$ Determined $by^{1}H$ NMR analysis using 0.2 mmol mesitylene as the internal standard. $^{c}$ Isolated yield.\ncarbon felt to a magnesium or platinum electrode did not influence the reactivity (entries 6 and 7). Finally, the reaction without electricity did not generate the desired product (entry 8). The scope of the electroreductive formylation was investigated under optimized conditions (Fig. 1). Barham previously reported that phosphinates of benzyl alcohols could also undergo reduction to give\nalkyl( $sp^{3})$ carbanions under electron-photoreduction conditions. $^{7d}$ Inspired by this work, we utilized acetates and phosphinates in the electroreductive formylation. Acetates or phosphinates of secondary benzyl alcohols produced formylated products 3-14 in 25-66$\\%$ NMR yields and 18-49$\\%$ isolated yields. Acyclic and cyclic benzyl alcohols with various substituents exhibited compatible reactivities. Heterocyclic compounds containing chromane, carbazole, or thiophene were also suitable for providing the desired products 15-17.\nWe further applied our method to obtain aldehydes containing quaternary carbon centers, which has rarely been reported to date. various tertiary benzyl alcohol derivatives underwent the desired reaction via C-O bond cleavage. Acyclic $\\alpha , \\alpha -$ disubstituted benzyl alcohols afforded aldehydes 18-20 in moderate yields (22-32$\\%$). Interestingly, tertiary benzyl alcohols attached to 4-6 membered rings led to relatively high yields of the desired products 21-27. Importantly, these cyclic $\\alpha , \\alpha -$ disubstituted formyl products are difficult synthetic targets for hydroformylation reactions.9 Despite the enormous potential of the process, its yield has remained moderate. The electron transfer process that takes place at the surface of the heterogeneous working electrode\nleads to the formation of reactive radicals or anionic species, which can accumulate and react with the electrode. This results in non-productive substrate consumption and electrode passivation, hampering the efficiency of the process. $^{10}$\nThe synthetic utility of the direct electrolysis was demonstrated by performing a gram-scale reaction (Scheme 2A). First, 20 mmol of 1 was reacted to generate formylated product 2 (1.07 g,33$\\%$). The yield of the 20 mmol scale reaction was similar to that of the 1 mmol scale reaction (43$\\%$). To gain further insight into the reaction mechanism, we conducted several control experiments. First, dimeric product $28^{11}$ was identified as a side-product, supporting the existence of a benzyl radical intermediate(Scheme 2B). Moreover, the reaction with benzyl alcohol did not afford the desired product; thus, we further investigated the role of OAc or $OPOPh_{2}.$\nNext, we measured the reduction potentials of the substrates using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2). Two possible pathways are conceivable for generating alkyl( $sp^{3})$ radical intermediates. First, a direct formation of alkyl radicals can be envisaged, similar to the case of alkyl halides, $^{12}$ because OAc and $OPOPh_{2}$ are good leaving groups. $^{13}$ Second, the generation of radical anions can occur due to their $\\pi -$ conjugated systems. The consecutive radical fragmentation leads to the desired alkyl radicals. $^{14}$ When the first electrochemical reaction proceeds via the direct formation of alkyl radicals, we hypothesized that the reduction peak potentials would be different depending on the stability of the generated radicals. $^{15}$ Indeed, in the case of phosphinates 29-32, we found that the reduction peak potential of 29 was 180 mV higher than that of 30(Fig. 2A). The same trend was observed for phosphinates of tertiary alcohols, as demonstrated by a 100 mV reduction peak potential difference between 31 and 32 (Fig. 2B). This result confirmed that benzylic radicals are more stable than alkyl radicals.\nAccordingly, the direct radical formation was proposed for phosphinate substrates. Interestingly, a different reduction potential relationship was observed for acetates 33 and 34. The peak reduction potential of 33, which forms a benzylic radical, was 700 mV lower than that of 34 that forms an alkyl radical (Fig. 2C). The peak reduction potential of 33 (-3.3 V) was comparable to that of 31 (-3.1 V). However, the significantly higher reduction potential of 34 (-2.6 V) indicated that 34 followed a different reaction pathway. In the case of 34, a radical anion is generated, which is more stable than the alkyl radicals on the surface of the working electrode. Nevertheless, both alkyl acetates and phosphinates yielded trace amounts of formylated products, showing similar reactivities (Scheme 2C).\nWe concluded that the fragmentation of radical anions into alkyl radicals occurred at the diffusion layer and not on the surface of the electrode. Accordingly, the generation of carbanions reactive towards DMF was not readily achieved. The major pathway was hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or protonation, which produced alkane compounds. $^{16}$ Based on these experimental results and those of previous studies, we proposed two reaction mechanisms (Scheme 3). The first step is the electrochemical reductive transformation of benzyl alcohol derivatives into benzyl radicals formed by a C-O bond cleavage, where the reduction potential values are distributed at around -3.0 V vs. $Fc^{+}/$ Fc. The evidence for the initial benzylic radical intermediate Int-1 was supported by the isolation of a dimer compound as a side-product (Scheme 3A).\nIn contrast, trace amounts of formyl products were observed when alkyl alcohol derivatives 32 and 34 were used. It was revealed that different radical intermediates could be generated depending on the substrate structure, especially in the case of alkyl acetates. However, radical intermediates Int-3 and Int-4 did not undergo formylation efficiently but produced protonated compounds. Based on these results, we proposed different\nView Article Online\nreaction mechanisms for the reductive transformation of benzylic or alkyl alcohol derivatives (Scheme 3B). Under electroreductive conditions, the aldehyde product can also be involved in the reaction by undergoing dimerization to form diols. $^{17}$ The cyclic voltammetry (CV) data of compound 3 suggests that the reduction potentials of the aldehydes are more negative than those of the phosphinate compounds, indicating a preference for the selective reduction of activated alcohols to prevent overreduction of the aldehydes (Fig. S4, ESI*)\nIn summary, we developed an electroreductive formylation of activated benzyl alcohols with DMF. Acetates and phosphinates of benzyl alcohols were reacted under operationally simple and mild conditions. Mechanistic experiments supported the reductive RPC reaction pathway. CV data indicated that either a benzylic radical generation by C-O bond cleavage or radical anion generation from alkyl acetates was possible. Finally, we successfully applied this method to gram-scale aldehyde synthesis. This method constitutes a new approach for accessing sterically hindered aldehydes, which are challenging synthetic targets.\nThe authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the C1 Gas Refinery Program (2021M3D3A1A01022103) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (2020R1A2C2013420).\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nNotes and references\n1(a)R.

While these unique features give chemists more opportunities to control reactivity and selectivity, they also increase the dimensionalities of a reaction and complicate the interactions between variables, making the optimization more challenging. Herein, we present a machine learning (ML) workflow that leverages physical organic descriptor-based yield prediction and orthogonal experimental design to strike a delicate balance between the need for sampling diversity and the pursuit of yield improvements, thereby efficiently identifying ideal conditions for enantioselective palladaelectro-catalyzed annulation from extensive synthetic space. This work shows the potential of synergizing organic electrochemistry and a data-driven approach to tackle multidimensional chemical optimization problems.\nINTRODUCTION\nOrganic electrochemistry has witnessed a remarkable resurgence as an environmentally benign approach for molecular syntheses. 1-9 Despite considerable progress in exploring the versatility of electricity in replacing costly redox agents, research focusing on utilizing other electrochemical properties has been limited. Recent studies have shed light on the fact that precise control of applied voltage/current or elaborate selection of solvents and electrolytes can improve the electrocatalytic efficiency significantly. $^{10-12}$ Moreover, the utilization of alternating current allows for the manipulation of chemoselectivity in organic electrosynthesis. $^{13-15}$ Other electrochemical parameters like reactor design have also been found to be associated with site selectivity. 16 Notably, the heterogeneous nature of electro-organic reactions underscores the pivotal role of electrode materials. $^{17-19}$ The Xu group discovered that changing the electrode material led to a significant difference in $yield^{20}$ and a switch in site $selectivity^{21}$ as well. Baran reported that modifying three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the electrode allowed the electroreduction of arenes to proceed at room temperature instead of $-78 ^\\circ\\text{C} .22$ Our group also disclosed that a significant improvement on position selectivity stemmed from the choice of electrode materials. 23 Recently, boron-doped diamond (BDD) has emerged as a promising next-generation electrode material owing to its unique properties.24-29 Kirste et al. achieved a distinct chemoselectivity when using the BDD electrode. $^{30}$ Nojima et al. found that BDD, despite deriving from carbon materials, gave high reactivity for anodic substitution reactions like platinum plate (Pt) anode. $^{31}$ Regardless of tremendous benefits from these electrochemical variables, the understanding about how they affect reaction efficacy and selectivity remains THE BIGGER PICTURE Significant advancement toward resource-economic synthesis was obtained by the merger of organometallic C-H activation with electrocatalysis. However, the introduction of electricity has heightened the dimensionality and complexity of electrochemical reactions, posing challenges for optimization.In this context, we designed a datadriven approach to optimize palladaelectro-catalyzed C-H annulation reactions, which utilized an orthogonal experimental design to ensure diverse sampling and effective exploration of the synthetic space. We also considered the various parameters, including electrode material, electrolyte, solvent, and applied potential/current, needed to facilitate a comprehensive exploration of the reaction chemical space. Additionally, by expanding the chemical space, the ML model identified different competitive conditions, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches in expediting the development of novel reactions within synthetic electrochemistry.\nprimitive. In addition, to interrogate how these physical factors, especially the interface of solvent and electrode, affect the reaction outputs is extremely challenging. In the last few decades, there has been a surge in transition metal-catalyzed C-H annulation reactions. $^{32,33}$ These annulation reactions are attractive to organic chemists because they provide highly valuable cyclic compounds from readily available starting materials in a rapid and sustainable way.34 Various transition metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Cu, Co, etc.) have been found to efficiently catalyze this transformation in the presence of external oxidants. 35,36 More recently, transition metal-catalyzed double C-H annulations using two alkyne molecules have been developed, providing polyaromatic compounds in an atom- and step-efficient manner.37-42 Asymmetric double C-H annulations yielding axially chiral compounds have also been achieved using a chiral rhodium complex catalyst. $^{43,44}$ In this context, the Xie group realized the Pd(II)-catalyzed asymmetric double C-H annulation of aldehydes and alkynes with good yields and enantiomeric excess (ee) $.^{45}$ Despite the progress, the superstoichiometric terminal oxidant required renders this reaction less attractive. Inspired by the asymmetric electrolysis previously developed by our group, 46 we attempted to develop the electro-oxidative C-H annulation to access atropoisomeric aldehydes. However, simply transferring the previous optimal condition to the electrocatalysis resulted in a quite low yield of 9$\\%$, albeit with 98$\\%$ ee.\nIn recent years, the application of machine learning (ML) in chemical synthesis has brought new opportunities for exploring advantageous conditions in a high-dimensional synthetic space using a data-driven approach. $^{47}$ This strategy allows for investigating the relationship between the various reaction parameters in a digitalized chemical space, thus avoiding dependency on the chemist's empirical knowledge and on mechanistic studies in traditional screenings. $^{48-51}$ In this regard, Granda et al. employed one-hot encoding and ML regression to guide the iterative optimization of reaction conditions on a robotic platform. $^{52}$ Burke, Grzybowski, and their colleagues utilized molecular fingerprints and one-hot encodings to represent the synthetic space, and they combined ML with robotic experiments to achieve efficient yield optimization.53 Additionally, the incorporation of optimization algorithms further enhances the sampling efficiency, surpassing traditional ML methods. Doyle and co-workers innovatively applied Bayesian optimization in synthetic transformations, demonstrating a superior optimization efficiency. 54 Jensen et al. employed an iterative approach that combined active learning and high-throughput experiments, achieving significant improvement for optimal condition identification over random sampling. 55 Eyke et al. developed a deep reinforcement learning strategy that showed a significant advantage, compared with traditional black-box optimization algorithm. 56 However, they mainly studied traditional cross-coupling reactions, as the research on more complex electrochemical organic reactions is still in its infancy. $^{57}$\nThe cooperation of ML and electrochemistry, two notable emerging frontiers, poses distinctive challenges due to the vast dimensions of the electrochemical space and the difficulty in determining the contribution of each dimension. 58 The additional dimensions and complexities introduced by electro-organic synthesis present additional challenges for data-driven modeling and reaction optimization, which were rarely addressed in previous ML studies. To tackle this problem, we reported an innovative approach that integrates data-driven yield prediction with classical orthogonal experimental design, which converted the high-dimensional structureactivity relationship into a digital form (Figure 1). Using this workflow, we successfully\nidentified the ideal condition for the target enantioselective palladaelectro-catalyzed annulation reaction from 8,640 candidate condition combinations. This approach featured the consideration of synergizing reaction parameters including electrode materials, electrolytes, solvents, and applied potentials/currents, thereby facilitating a comprehensive exploration of the reaction chemical space. Further, this work presents an effective strategy for optimizing electrochemical conditions, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing high-throughput robotic platforms, providing a robust data engine to accelerate the development of electrochemical transformations.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nDesign of optimization workflow\nUsing 2-(ortho-tolyl)benzaldehyde 1a and diphenylacetylene 2a as the model substrates, our optimization focused on four key dimensions that are closely related to electrochemistry (Figure 2A): electrode materials (with 16 combinations of graphite felt (GF), Pt, iron plate (Fe), and BDD as anode or cathode), solvents (offering 10 options such as acetic acid (AcOH), trifluoroethanol (TFE), and various 1:1 mixed solvents), supporting electrolytes (comprising 9 options, including LiCIO4 and NaOPiv), and discharge rate into the reaction (with 6 choices involving various constant currents and constant potentials). Since time and temperature are not discrete quantities and less determining, we have excluded them from the MLguided exploration of electrochemical space. The four variables collectively created a massive synthetic space with 8,640 possible combinations. The high-dimensional nature of the structure-performance relationship in the target synthetic space presented challenges for the classic optimization strategy via simple control variables. For the ML-guided reaction optimization, the commonly applied greedy approach would directly predict the top-K possibilities with iterative data addition of\nexperimental samplings. We did not consider this strategy either, because it is sensitive to initial sampling and would likely fall into local optima of the synthetic space, which may not be suitable for our reaction optimization starting from zero data. In this context, we designed an optimization workflow combining ML yield prediction with the concept of orthogonal experimental design to achieve a balance between the diversity of the synthetic space sampling and the greedy requirement of yield improvement.\nFigure 2B elaborates on the details of the designed optimization workflow. The core of the optimization workflow design lies in the introduction of orthogonal experimental design as a constraint requirement in the top-K sorting provided by the ML model. The orthogonal constraint increased the diversity of the experimental samplings, which gradually transitioned to a greedy search by relaxing the orthogonal constraint based on the threshold of optimization progress. Our optimization started with 16 initial experiments covering the 16 selections of electrode materials, with other dimensions distributed as evenly as possible. In addition, we strictly required these 16 experiments to satisfy the orthogonality constraint, which means that only one dimension can have the same selection comparing any two experiments. Subsequently, we used the available experimental data to build a ML model(vide infra) to predict the reaction yield for the entire synthetic space in the optimization process. Based on the predicted yield and the orthogonality constraint, we selected four sets of conditions for experimental verification, and the obtained\ndata were further fed back to the ML model for updating the predictions. In stage 1, we set the highest orthogonality constraint, which is the same as the initial experimental samplings allowing only one dimension to be the same between any two experimental tests. When there is no combination of conditions that satisfies the orthogonality constraint among the top 10$\\%$ of predicted selections, the optimization process advanced to the next stage. The optimization logic in stage 2 is the same, but the orthogonality constraint is relaxed, allowing two dimensions to be the same between any two experimental tests. Stage 2 ends with the same threshold when no combination of conditions among the top 100 of the predictions satisfies the orthogonality constraint. In the final stage 3, the orthogonality constraint is fully relaxed, allowing three dimensions to be the same, which is essentially a standard greedy optimization. In this stage, we tried a series of top-K reaction conditions based on the ML-predicted yield and identified the optimal reaction condition for the target palladaelectro-catalyzed annulation.\nDevelopment of the ML model\nThe designed optimization workflow was indeed very effective, and the optimization results and analysis are provided in Figure 3. A series of physical organic descriptors were used to encode the reaction system in ML modeling (Figure 3A). For the electrode material, we used the onset $potential^{59}$ of hydrogen evolution reactions and the electrochemical surface area as the encoding parameters; regarding the electrolyte, onset potentials and Tafel $slopes^{59}$ from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of a possible\nintermediate Pd-imine complex A at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, along with the conductivity in different solvents, were applied as the descriptors; for the solvent, a series of physical organic parameters (LogP, hydrogen bond donor, etc.) and electrochemistry-related properties (dielectric constant, dipole moment, operating potential window, viscosity, etc.) was employed as descriptors; one-hot encoding was employed to encode the applied current and potential. These encodings collectively form a 57-dimensional reaction vector, offering a digitalized perspective of the electro-organic reaction system. Various algorithms were evaluated for reaction prediction, including bagging (BG),60 decision tree (DT) $,^{61}$ extra-trees (ET) $,^{62}$ gradient boosting (GB) $,^{63}\\space k-$ nearest neighbor regression(KNR) $,^{64}$ kernel ridge regression (KRR) $,^{65}$ linear support vector regression(LSVR) $,^{66}$ random forest (RF) $,^{67}$ ridge, $^{68}$ support vector machine (SVR) $,^{66}$ and XGBoost(XGB).69 Considering the perturbation of ML modeling for each round of data addition, we re-evaluated the algorithms' performances through the 10-fold cross-validation for each round. The model with the highest accuracy was selected to predict reaction yield and recommend the next-round reaction.\nFigure 3B illustrates the outcomes of ML-driven yield optimization.As the number of optimization rounds increased, the average and maximum yields obtained from experimental validations showed a consistent upward trend. The highest yield in each cycle improved from an initial 17$\\%$ to 70$\\%$. Including the initial samplings, it only took 12 rounds and a total of 68 experiments to conclude the optimization search within the chemical space. These yields of experimental verifications confirmed that the ML optimization provided the correct direction for exploring the synthetic space. The optimized condition involves a platinum cathode and an inexpensive and userfriendly GF anode, AcOH/TFE mixed solvent, NaOPiv as the supporting electrolyte, and a current of 0.3 mA applied for 36 h. However, since some starting materials were still observed after the reaction, we increased the reaction time to 48 h while keeping all other parameters constant, resulting in an improved yield of 90$\\%$.To further understand the entire synthetic space from a digital perspective, we projected the predicted synthetic space of 8,640 possibilities onto a two-dimensional map using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method (Figure 3C). It was shown that the synthetic space with 8,640 possibilities can be effectively represented by 10 groups based on the choice of solvent (Figure S19). Additionally, the results indicated that most selections within the candidate synthetic space would yield very low productivities (below 20$\\%$), and only a few combinations of conditions can create \"hotspots\" in the synthetic space, enabling effective electrochemical synthesis. The color-coded circles represented experimental samplings at different optimization stages, providing a clear perspective of the ML-guided optimization route. In the first stage (purple circles), the model explored various groups under orthogonal constraints, discovering the highlighted area with high-yield performances. This group includes six smaller independent sub-groups, representing the selection of currents and potentials (Figure S19). These sub-groups were further examined in the second stage (blue circles) to identify the most promising one. In the final stage (green circles), a greedy search was performed within one of the six sub-groups, ultimately identifying the optimal condition in the synthetic space.\nBy analyzing the exploration process of reaction conditions in each optimization round, we can also interpret the samplings of ML-guided optimization strategy (Figure S18). Regarding the important anode/cathode selection, the model diligently explores various options until the 8th round. Likewise, when it comes to electrolytes, the model continues its exploration until the 6th round. Notably, the model efficiently identifies AcOH:TFE (1:1) as the optimal solvent. Furthermore, the feature\nimportance analysis of the final yield prediction model has shed light on the dimensions critical to ML from a different perspective (Figure 3D). We observed that physicochemical properties related to electrochemistry, particularly the electrochemical surface area of electrodes and the conductivity of electrolytes, play a pivotal role in the model's predictive accuracy. This observation is consistent with the model's consistent focus on these dimensions throughout its search process. Furthermore, we confirmed the effectiveness of the chemical descriptors in both interpolative (Figure S20) and extrapolative (Figures S21 and S22) yield prediction tasks by comparing them with other baseline descriptors.\nSubstrate scope\nAfter successfully identifying the optimized conditions guided by ML, we next studied the versatility of the enantioselective pallada-electrocatalysis. A number of biaryls containing electron-rich and electron-withdrawing groups provided the desired axially chiral biaryls with excellent enantioselectivities (Figure 4A). Biaryls with substituents at the 2' position, such as Me, Et, Ph, and Cl, were identified as suitable substrates for producing the desired chiral aldehydes (3-6) with good yields and excellent atroposelectivities. However, less bulky OMe group led to a significant decrease in enantioselectivity due to the steric hindrance effect (7),70 which was further demonstrated by the improved enantioselectivity to 82$\\%$ with the more sterically demanding OPh group (8). Multifunctionalized aldehydes were well tolerated in the atroposelective annulation, yielding products with up to 90$\\%$ yield and 96$\\%$ee (9 and10). Aldehydes featuring electron-deficient or electron-rich aromatic rings were also smoothly incorporated into this transformation, providing the desired enantiomers (11-19) in moderate to excellent yields (44$\\%$-90$\\%$) and outstanding enantiomeric control (95$\\%$-99$\\%$ ee). The N-arylindole-based aldehyde (20) was also well tolerated in the atroposelective annulation with outstanding enantioselectivity (92$\\%$ee). Furthermore, arylthiophene proceeded efficiently to give the desired product 21, albeit with reduced enantioselectivity attributed to reduced steric resistance.\nNext, various alkynes 2 were explored (Figure 4B). Substrates featuring electrondonating groups, such as alkyl and methoxy substituents, proceeded the reaction with high yields and excellent ee, affording products 22-25. The structure of 23 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Alkynes bearing electron-deficient halogen groups were converted to the desired products 26-27, albeit with diminished yields. Notably, the trimethylsilyl group was well tolerated under the electrolysis conditions (28), serving as a handle for further transformations, such as Hiyama cross-coupling. To our delight, the alkyl alkyne was also compatible in this case, delivering product 29 in moderate yield and 97$\\%$ ee.\nExpanding chemical space of the ML model\nTo assess the adaptability of our ML-driven optimization strategy, we posed a further challenge: could the model utilize existing yield data to identify productive conditions distinctly different from those previously optimized by widening the electrochemical space? To explore this, we introduced three extra electrode materialsnickel foam (Ni), reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC), and glassy carbon (GC)-and expanded the solvent range to include five variants with hexafluoro-2-propanol(HFIP). This broadened the initial chemical space from 8,640 to 39,690 possibilities(Figure 5A). By leveraging the accumulated yield data, we modeled and evaluated the potential within this enlarged space. The top four predicted combinations underwent experimental verification (Figure 5B). Remarkably, all of these combinations yielded high results, with one of them reaching a yield of 83$\\%$. Furthermore, the best combination used iron electrodes, NaO2CAd electrolyte, and a HFIP/AcOH solvent\nChem 10, 1-12, July 11, 2024 7\nGF $\\prod _{R}^{t}Pt$\n|Ar1\nAr1|\nPd(OAC $)_{2}(10$ mo1$\\%$)\nCHO\nHO\nL-tertLeucine (30 mol$\\%$)\\\\ NaOPiv(2 equiiv.)\nAr2\nAr2|\nH\n$\\overline{AcOH:TFE(1:1)}\\\\ 70 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,0.3$ mA,48h\n1\n2\n3-29\nA Scope of biaryls\n\\begin{matrix} 3 , \\space R = M e , 9 0 $\\%$ , 9 9 $\\%$ \\space e e \\\\ 4 , R = E t , 9 1 $\\%$ , 9 9 $\\%$ \\space e e \\\\ 5 , , R = P h , 5 5 $\\%$ , , 9 7 $\\%$ \\space e e \\\\ 6 , R = C l , 5 5 $\\%$ \\space , 9 7 6 $\\%$ \\\\ 7 , R = C l , 5 2 $\\%$ $\\%$ \\\\ 7 , R = O O P , , R = O P h , 2 7 $\\%$ , , 8 2 $\\%$ e e \\end{matrix}\nPh\n$\\overset{CHO}{Me}$\nPh\nPh\n$_{R}^{CHO}$\n$\\overset{CHO}{Me}$\nPh\nPh.\nPh.\nPh.\nPh\nCHO\n\\begin{matrix} 1 1 , R = 3 - F , 7 8 $\\%$ , 9 6 $\\%$ e e \\\\ 1 2 , R = 4 F , 6 3 $\\%$ , 9 7 $\\%$ e e \\\\ 1 3 , R = 5 F , 5 4 $\\%$ , 9 7 $\\%$ e e \\end{matrix}\nPh\nMe\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh Me\nPh\n9,85$\\%$,96$\\%$ ee\n10,90$\\%$,93$\\%$ ee\nF、\nCI\nOMe\nR、\nMeO、\ns\nPh\nCHO\nCHO\n$_{Et}^{CHO}$\nPh\n$\\overset{CHO}{Me}$\nPh\nN\nph\nPh\nPh\n$^{CHO^{CHO}}$\nPh\nPh\n$\\overset{CHO}{\\rightarrow Me}$\nPh\nMe\nPh\nMe\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\nPh\n14,75$\\%$,97$\\%$ ee\n15,R=Me,44$\\%$,96$\\%$ee\n19,89$\\%$,97$\\%$ ee\n20,45$\\%$,92$\\%$ ee\n17,R=Me,72$\\%$,95$\\%$ee18,R=OMe,54$\\%$,97$\\%$eeeeeee\n21,52$\\%$,64$\\%$ ee\n16,R=Pr,47$\\%$,96$\\%$ ee\nB Scope of alkynes\n(Me)3SiMeO\nOMe\nR\n11\n(Me) $_{3}Si$ 、\nOMe\nR.\nCHO\\\\Me\n22,,R=44-Me,891$\\%$,96$\\%$ee\\\\23,R=4-4B,891$\\%$,95$\\%$eee MeO CHO\nPr\nPr\n$\\overset{CHO}{Me}$\nR\n(Me)3Si\nPr\nce\nPr\nSi(Me)3\nR\n23,CCDC2255445\n28,36$\\%$,98$\\%$ ee\n29,42$\\%$,97$\\%$ ee\nmixture, which significantly differed from our previously obtained optimized condition. It was exciting to observe that replacing expensive platinum electrodes with inexpensive and user-friendly iron electrodes as cathodes gave comparably good results. The generality of these reaction conditions was further validated on representative substrates (Figure S53). These results highlighted the proficiency of Al in innovating beyond previously known efficacious selections.\nConclusions\nWe have designed a ML-guided workflow to enable the optimization of conditions for electrochemical synthesis reactions, which effectively integrated data-driven yield prediction modeling with orthogonal experimental design. By setting a threshold for optimization progress, we achieved a gradual transition from orthogonal sampling to greedy optimization, effectively balancing the need for sampling diversity and target improvement in the optimization of high-dimensional synthetic\nspace. The established workflow successfully guided the optimization of reaction conditions for the target palladaelectro-catalyzed C-H annulation. Without any human supervision, the ideal reaction condition from 8,640 possibilities was identified through only 68 experiments. This condition enabled the efficient and selective synthesis of a series of atropoisomers with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. To further highlight the potential of a ML model in predicting productive conditions of electrochemical synthesis, we expanded the original chemical space and successfully utilized ML to identify other conditions that were distinctly different from the original optimal condition. Our research demonstrates that combining data-driven approaches with synthetic electrochemistry has the potential to efficiently solve multidimensional chemical optimization problems and to greatly accelerate the development of organic synthesis.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nResource availability\nLead contact\nFurther information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Prof. Dr. Lutz Ackermann (lutz.ackermann@chemie.unigoettingen.de).\nMaterials availability\nThe electrocatalysis was carried out in an undivided cell under air, equipped with a GF anode $(10 \\times 15 \\times 6$ mm) and a Pt cathode $(25 \\times 10 \\times 0.125$ mm).

We have established a NaHmediated activation strategy for the generation of highly reactive aryne species in a controlled manner. The resulting arynes can efficiently participate in a $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bond-insertion reaction with unactivated ketones, which is difficult to achieve by existing methods. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the two adjacent iodines in o-diiodoarenes play critical roles in the formation of aryne. The nucleophilic attack of hydride to the electrophilic iodine requires that the adjacent iodine act as a directing group to accelerate this process, whereas mono-substituted iodobenzene lacking the neighboring-group participation makes it difficult. The in-situformed enolates from ketones are proposed to adopt tetrameric aggregates to react with arynes, which accounts for the high regiochemistry for substrates with bulky substituents.\nINTRODUCTION\nAryne chemistry has a long-standing interest in organic synthesis.1-6 The multifaceted reactions of the versatile reactive intermediates with suitable arynophiles offer a strategic approach for rapid functionalization of ubiquitous aromatic structures. 7-12 The reaction efficiency is often dictated by the constitution of the corresponding aryne precursor and the way in which the intermediate is formed. Although various methods have been developed for aryne generation, $^{1-6,13}$ practical methods for producing arynes involve the removal of two adjacent atoms or substituents(Scheme 1A) from benzenoid precursors, such as halo(pseudohalo)arenes and o-dihaloarenes. In the formation of the active species, strong bases (such as NaNH2), hindered lithium amide (LDA, LiTMP, LDAM, etc.), alkyllithium, or the Grignard reagent are generally used (Scheme $1A).^{14,15}$ The harsh reaction conditions reduce compatibility with functional groups and arynophiles. Moreover, in many cases, low reaction yields are accompanied by complicated side reactions as a result of the difficulty in controlling the formation of the highly reactive aryne and its quick decomposition, even at a reaction temperature as low as $-50 ^\\circ\\text{C} .16$\nKobayashi's method by using o-silylaryl triflates as aryne progenitors has changed the landscape of the aryne chemistry in synthesis (Scheme $1B).^{1,17,18}$ The broad application of the chemistry attributes to the generation of the aryne species in a controllable manner under mild reaction conditions. However, the high cost and tedious synthesis of the o-silylaryl triflate precursors restrict the practical application particularly in an industrial setting. $^{19,20}A$ new method for the controllable generation of\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\nArynes have been recognized as one of the most useful reactive intermediates in organic chemistry because of their unrivaled capacity to deliver structurally diverse molecular architectures. However, the reaction efficiency and utility of arynes are often dependent on the used precursors and reaction conditions. Developing new protocols attests to the synthetic versatility of the intermediates. Here, we describe a simple method for the generation of arynes from ortho-diiodoarenes and NaH under mild conditions. Notably, the arynes generated in this manner enable an unprecedented $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bondinsertion reaction of unactivated ketones with a broad functionalgroup tolerance. Mechanistic insights into how aryne is generated and reacts with enolates (in tetrameric form) are also provided.\n$\\boxed{}$\nbenzynes/arynes from cost-effective, readily accessible o-dihaloarenes would considerably expand the preparative utility of these remarkable intermediates.\no-Diiodobenzene (1a) is an attractive benzyne precursor because it is cheap, stable, and commercially available.21 More importantly, the weak C-I bond (bond-dissociation energy [BDE]=64 kcal/mol) can be readily cleaved by a base under mild reaction conditions. However, the reported methods for benzyne formation have been challenged by the difficulty in controlling the formation of highly active benzyne species, even in reactions conducted at $<-60 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,^{17}$ by delivering complex product mixtures with low reaction yields.22 Other methods for benzyne generation from o-diiodobenzene (1a) have been actively pursued.23-26\nThe Chiba group has developed a series of impressive sodium hydride (NaH)-mediated organic transformations, 27 such as hydrodehalogenation of aryl halides 28 and amide-directed C-H sodiation.29 In our studies of exploring new reactivities of NaH for organic synthesis, $^{30-32}$ we serendipitously found that NaH in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dimethylacetamide (DMA) could generate benzyne efficiently from o-diiodobenzene, which was trapped by furan to afford a Diels-Alder adduct in 52$\\%$ yield (Scheme 5C). These experiments showed for the first time that the phenyl anion could be generated by the removal of iodide ion with NaH.33 We questioned whether the operationally simple NaH-mediated aryne formation method could be explored for new organic transformations, which are not easily achieved by existing approaches, including Kobayashi's method.\nAryne insertion into the $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bond is an efficient method for the preparation of ubiquitous vicinal difunctionalized arenes. $^{1,3}$ Since the pioneering work of Guyot and Molho, 34 Shair et al., 35 Tambar and Stoltz, 36 and Yoshida et al., 37 a wide range of active methylene compounds have been identified for this rearrangement. 38-42 However, these processes are restricted to the highly activated ketones bearing either electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or aryl groups at the a-position (Scheme 1C). By contrast, simple alkyl ketones possessing intrinsic low activity can react only with the arynes generated from halo(pseudohalo)arenes by using strong bases but affording benzocyclobutenols or anthracenes as the products (Scheme $1C).^{11,43-46}$ Although aryne insertion into a special cyclopentanone was reported by Danheiser and $Helgason^{47}$ and cyclohexyne insertion into various cyclic ketones was disclosed by Carreira and co-workers, 48,49 aryne insertion into acyclic ketones remains elusive. Herein, we wish to disclose the results of the investigation leading to uncovering a new strategy for aryne generation from o-diiodoarenes activated by commercially available 60$\\%$ NaH dispersion in mineral oil. The developed method, which proceeds under operationally simple reaction conditions and can be easily scaled up, does not require any metal additives or stringently anhydrous conditions. Furthermore, the new reactivity of the resulted arynes has been transformed into a viable process for direct aryne $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bond insertion into unactivated alkyl-aryl ketones. The method serves as a general approach to the rearranged complex o-alkyl-aryl ketone products, which are difficult to access by traditional methods, in up to 91$\\%$ yield(Scheme 1D). Of equal importance, the mechanism of how aryne is generated and then reacts with ketones has been uncovered through DFT calculations.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nExploration and optimization\nOur study began with the optimization of the reaction conditions for the generation of benzyne from o-diiodobenzene 1a and the subsequent insertion reaction with Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, 199 Ren'ai Road, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, P.R.

Extensive exploration and optimization studies revealed that the treatment of 2a in THF (0.05 M) with 2 equiv of o-diiodobenzene 1a and 3 equiv of NaH at $50 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 4 h afforded o-alkyl-aryl ketone 3a in a $92 $\\%$ ^{1}H$ NMR yield (entry 1 and Table S1). Decreasing the loading of both 1a(1.5 equiv) and NaH (2.5 equiv) eroded the reaction yield (80$\\%$, entry 2). To illustrate the role of NaH in the process, we probed a variety of frequently used strong bases(entries 3-8). It seems that the nature of counter cations of these hydrides plays a key role in the formation of benzyne (entries 3 and 4) presumably because they can influence solubility of hydride, whereas LDA, BuLi, and i-PrMgCl delivered the desired product in no more than 25$\\%$ yield (entries 5-8). Obviously, these homogeneous phase methods are inferior to the generation of benzyne. The results are consistent with observations in the literature. $^{15,16}$ The solvents have a pronounced effect on the process as well. The reaction proceeded smoothly in THF (entry 1) and DMA (88$\\%$yield, entry 9), whereas it failed in dimethoxyethane (DME) (entry 10). We believe that the limited solubility of solid base NaH (60$\\%$ dispersion in mineral oil) in THF, DMA, and DME enabled hydride to be gradually brought into the organic phase for the programed deiodization of o-diiodobenzene 1a to control the generation of the phenyl anion and subsequent benzyne. The failure in DME might be due to\nBr\nBr OTf Br\n1a1\n1a2\n1a3\nthe difficulty in the efficient formation of the reactive enolate from its ketone precursor. In addition, the reaction conducted at room temperature (RT) or $60 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ was favorable (entries 11 and 12). Three representative o-dihalobenzenes, 1a1-1a3, were then investigated (entries 13-15). 1-Bromo-2-iodobenzene (1a1) proved to be a competent benzyne precursor as well in that it produced 3a in 55$\\%$ yield (68$\\%$from 1a at RT; entry 12 vs. entry 13). Similarly, o-iodophenyl triflate 1a2 also gave the desired product but in low, 17$\\%$ yield (entry 14). Interestingly, o-dibromobenzene was thoroughly inert to NaH, and no reaction occurred (entry 15). Therefore, breaking the relatively weak C-I bond is indispensable in the formation of phenyl anion with NaH to generate benzyne. Finally, we recognized that the concentration of the solution had a considerable influence on the reaction such that the dilute solution gave a higher yield (entries 16 and17). As a compromise, we used 0.05 M to examine the substrate scope.\nSubstrate scope\nUnder the optimized conditions, we first probed the generality of the benzyne insertion into diverse aryl alkyl ketones (Scheme 2). We examined a series of\nO Alky\nNaH (3 equiv) $\\begin{matrix}THF(0.05M)\\\\ 50 ^\\circ\\text{C} C,4h \\end{matrix}$\n||Ar\n2a-2ce(0.5 mmol)\n1a(2 equiv\n3a-3co\nScheme 2.

For products 3ar and 3bn-3bz, NaH (3.0 mmol, 6 equiv) and 1a (2.5 mmol, 5 equiv) were used. For product 3cd, NaH (2.0 mmol, 4 equiv) and 1a (1.5 mmol, 3 equiv) were used.\npropiophenone derivatives (2a-2y) bearing various substituents on the benzene ring. We observed that a great number of functional groups were compatible with the reaction conditions, and the electronic and steric perturbations of these substituents were all tolerated, as evidenced by the formation of products 3a-3y in moderate to good yields. Significantly, all halogens were stable enough to survive the presence of NaH (3c-3f,3s,and 3y),thus constituting an important advantage over traditional methods. Interestingly, although o-diiodobenzene was reactive to NaH, the single iodine on the benzene ring was intact under the reaction conditions(3f). Notably, the substrates involving different types of ether or thioether subunits proceeded smoothly to give the desired rearrangement products in good yields(3g-3),3r,3u,3w,and3x).Furthermore,several substrates bearing biologically important fluorine-containing groups, such as -F, - $OCF_{3}, \\space - SCF_{3},$ and - $CF_{3}$ , could efficiently participate in the process with high efficiency (3c,3j,3l,and 3m). Moreover, the successful generation of 30, 3p, and 3v (which contained versatile CN, -Bpin, and alkynyl groups) allowed for further functionalization of the products. In further exploration, we found that the phenyl moiety of ketone 2a-2y could be replaced by other aromatic structures, such as naphthalene (2z and 2aa), pyrene (2ab), pyridine (2ac), and thiophene (2ad), delivering the corresponding insertion products 3z-3ad successfully. Importantly, our strategy also created a concise route for the direct introduction of a methyl group on aromatic rings. The structures are not easily accessed. $^{50,51}$ The simple treatment of commercially available aryl methyl ketones 2ae-2al with o-diiodobenzene and NaH afforded o-methylaryl ketones 3ae-3al in good yields.\nIn addition to methyl and ethyl aryl ketones, other variants are also amenable. A variety of primary (3am-3bh and 3ca-3ce), secondary (3bi-3bm), and (hetero)cycloalkyl groups (3bn-3bz) can be applied by the protocol for the synthesis of structurally diverse adjacent alkyl-aryl ketones. The length of the linear alkyl from C4 to C17 has a limited effect on the reaction yield (83$\\%$ for 3am vs.71$\\%$ for 3ao). Moreover, notably, the alkyl moiety of ketone carrying various functional groups can be tolerated. These functionalities include indole (3at), alkene (3au and 3av), alkyne (3aw), ether (3ax and 3ay), O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)hydroxylamine (OTBS) and tetrahydropyranyl (THP) (3az and 3ba), acetal (3bb), and amines (3bc-3be). Furthermore, ketone substrates bearing oxygen and sulfur featured at the a-position of alkyl moiety can deliver benzyl (thio)ethers (3bf-3bh, 3bl, and 3bm), useful building blocks, and biologically interesting functional groups. The generality of our protocol is further demonstrated by the synthesis of various (hetero)cycloalkyl products 3bn3bz. In these cases, a spectrum of cycloalkanes with ring sizes ranging from four to seven were successfully connected to a benzene ring via the efficient rearrangement process to furnish products 3bn-3bv. Moreover, piperidine (3bw), tetrahydropyran(3bx and 3by), and tetrahydrofuran (3bz) were also viable heterocycles for these transformations. Of particular significance is the observation that our method could be used for late-stage skeletal editing of structurally complex molecules, such as 3ca(from chenodeoxycholic acid), 3cb (from lithocholic acid), and 3cc (from adapalene), in impressive yields (43$\\%$-67$\\%$). It is worth noting that the free phenolic hydroxyl group of ketone 2cd was identified to be a new reactive site in that it afforded product 3cd, which possesses an interesting o-iodophenyl ether subunit. This discovery could open up a new research direction and exhibits the great potential of the\nt-butyl ketones\n$\\circ$\n$R_{R^{2}R^{3}}^{R^{1}}$\nR\nStandard conditions\n$R^{1}$\n$R^{3}$\n2cf-2cl\n1a\n3cf-3cl\n$R^{1},R^{2},R^{3}$ ?H\nOPh\n。\n0\n。。\n0\n0\n$\\circ$\n3cf,60$\\%$\n3cg,39$\\%$\n3ch,56$\\%$\n3ci,55$\\%$\nn-Bu\n0\n$\\circ$\nMe\n。\n$H_{3}C$\n$H_{3}C$\nMe\n0、\nH\nH MeO 日\n日\n0、\n日\nMe\n3cj,81$\\%$ MeO 3ck,57$\\%$\n0\n3cl,54$\\%$\ncyclopropyl ketones\n。\n。\nO\nAlkyl\nAlkyl\nStandard\n2cn-2cq\nconditions\n2cm, recovered\n3cm,0$\\%$\n3cn-3cq\nF\n0\nPh\n0\n。\n$\\rhd$\n3cn,62$\\%$\n3co,44$\\%$\n3cp,70$\\%$\n3cq,41$\\%$\no-diiodobenzene/NaH system. Finally, under the standard reaction conditions, a ring-expansion tool was placed with benzocycloheptanone 2ce to give a synthetically challenging medium 9-membered ring in 30$\\%$ yield.\nIn addition to probing aryl alkyl ketones, we also probed alkyl alkyl ketones. To avoid the reaction complexation by the formation of two regioisomers, we explored the rearrangement process with t-alkyl alkyl ketones, in which only one a-position containing H can undergo deprotonation for the formation of enolate (Scheme 3, top). As shown, these substrates performed equally well. Benzyne could efficiently be inserted into their C-C bond to give products 3cf-3cl in good yields. Moreover, more complex ketone substrates derived from biologically active structures, such as $\\beta -D-$ fructopyranose (2ci), trolox (2cj), estrone (2ck), and estradiene dione-3-keta(2cl), could undergo the reaction to afford compounds 3ci-3cl. Especially impressive was the ring expansion of cyclopentanone in steroid skeleton, which gave rise to cycloheptanone products 3ck and 3cl. Again, this demonstrates the preparation power of the method for late-stage skeletal editing. In the study of cyclopropylderived ketones (Scheme 3, bottom), we noticed that 2cm was inert to the process and completely recovered under the reaction conditions.

Therefore, we designed new cyclopropyl alkyl ketones for the reaction. To our delight, these substances proceeded regioexclusively to deliver structures 3cn-3cq in moderate to good yields. The studies further expand the scope of the process.To further illustrate the generality of the new method, we evaluated diverse o-diiodoarenes as aryne precursors (Scheme 4). We note that these o-diiodo compounds could be easily prepared from cheap materials (see the supplemental experimental\nprocedures). First, symmetrical precursors 1b-1f were well tolerated under the optimal reaction conditions to smoothly generate arynes, which then reacted with ketone 2a to afford regioisomers 4b-4f in $42\\%-76\\%$ yields. For unsymmetrical o-diiodobenzene derivatives, we found that the regioselectivity of the products depended on the type and position of the substituents. For example, the insertion reaction of 3-phenyl-5-methylbenzyne proceeded well to give 4g in 62$\\%$ yield and with high regioselectivity. When 3-methyl precursors 1h and 1i were used, a mixture of two isomers (4h/4h' and 4i/4i') was obtained in a 54:46 and 62:38 ratio, respectively. A similar trend was observed for meta-substituted benzynes efficiently generated from 1j-1o. The desired products 4j-4o were formed in moderate to good yields and with the regioisomer ratio from 50:50 to 66:34. Again, like the aforementioned 3f and 3ai, in the case of 4j, the single C-I bond in the substrate was not affected under the reaction conditions. In the case of 4m/4m', when one iodine was replaced by bromine in the aryne precursor, lower yields were obtained but with similar regioselectivity. Subsequently, the conversions of naphthalene-, indol-, and pyridine-based precursors 1p-1r were also accomplished, leading to two isomers (4p/4p'-4r/4r') in 14$\\%$-65$\\%$ yields. Finally, the more challenging 1,2-diiodocyclohex-1-ene 1s could also generate strained cyclic alkyne under the promotion of NaH at $70 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ and provided an interesting product (4s) that might undergo a $4 \\pi$ electrocyclic ring-opening $process^{49,52,53}$ (see the supplemental information for the proposed mechanism).\nHaving evaluated more than 110 substrates for the synthetic power, we took these conveniently produced products for further synthetic elaboration to demonstrate the practicality and create new structures (Scheme 5). First, we conducted a gramscale synthesis by using ketone 2a and o-diiodobenzene 1a under slightly modified reaction conditions (a higher concentration at 0.1 M) to reduce the consumption of solvent (Scheme 5A). Comparable yields to 0.5 mmol scale were obtained at 10(twice) and 20 mmol levels, showing the reliable reproducibility of our protocol. Moreover, when the concentration was further increased to 0.2 M, similar synthetic efficiency for 3c and 3g at 10 mmol level was achieved.\nBenzophenones are versatile building blocks in synthesis. As shown in Scheme 5B, the ketone group of 3a was conveniently transformed into alkene 5 and alkane 6. Compounds 3c and 3g were efficiently reduced to alcohols 7c and 7g. Significantly, the resulting diphenylmethanol 7c and 7g could be split into respective aniline 8c and aldehyde 8g by simple treatment with TsONHMe in hexafluoroisopropanol(HFIP) at RT. $^{54}$ The regioselectivity of the products could be easily tuned and controlled by modulation of the electronic properties of ring B in alcohol 7. The EWG (-F) led to the formation of o-alkyl aniline (8c) as a major product, whereas the electron-donating group (-OMe) formed o-alkylbenzaldehyde (8g) favorably.\nThe development of \"ideal\" aryne generation methods has long been sought by organic chemists because arynes are generated in situ. $^{1-6}$ The constitution of an aryne precursor and its generation conditions play key roles in aryne-engaged transformation. Because of their ready accessibility and affordability, o-dihaloarenes as precursors make a significant contribution to aryne chemistry in the early stage. In the 1950s and 1960s, they were intensively studied with strong bases, such as PhLi, NaNH2, and LDA for aryne generation. $^{15,16}$ However, these strategies fall short of compatibility with functional groups and arynophiles that are vulnerable under these harsh conditions. Therefore, they were replaced by other methods, particularly Kobayashi's protocol. In this study, we uncovered a new NaH-mediated aryne-formation strategy using o-diiodoarenes as progenitors. The method enables the generation of aryne in a controlled manner.

These reactions also provide solid evidence supporting the aryne involvement in these reactions. Furthermore, Kobayashi's protocol failed to deliver the product, as shown in Zeng and co-workers' study of the reaction of o-silylaryl triflate with a-phenylethyl ketone 2as (Scheme 5D).38 Only active ketones, such as a-benzyl ketone 13, delivered product 14. However, our protocol obtained a 72$\\%$ yield of insertion product 3as with 2as (Scheme 2).\nInterestingly, we also found that neither TMS enol ether 2as' nor the addition of NaH to activate 2as could give desired product 3as (Scheme 5D). We believe the unrivaled capacity of NaH mediated the generation of the aryne, and at the same time, the activation of the less reactive ketone made the process possible.\nMechanistic investigations\nTo gain mechanistic insights into the NaH-mediated aryne formation reaction, we carried out DFT calculations at the SMD(THF)/B3LYP/6-31+G(d)(LANL2DZ for l)level(see the supplemental information for details) with o-dioidobenzene substrate 1a. A complexation (e.g., Int1) between 1a and solvated NaH via the electrophilic $l^{55,56}$ and hydridic H interactions is initially formed endergonically by 4.2 kcal/mol (Scheme 6A; Figures S1 and S2). The resulting Int1 is then transformed into the key phenyl sodium intermediate, Int2, through transition state TS1, in which the dissociation of the C-I bond is facilitated by the synergistic activation of NaH and the second iodo. Such a network with $Na^{+}$ coordinated to both the hydride and the adjacent I helps the reaction, and only an activation free energy of8.1 kcal/mol is required. The formation of a phenyl anion from mono-iodobenzene is difficult because it requires an estimated activation energy of 32.9 kcal/mol (see the supplemental information and Figures S4 and S5). The neighboring-group-assisted deiodination activation mode was also demonstrated in NaH-mediated Fries rearrangement of 2-iodophenyl benzoate (15) via 17 to generate aryl anion 18 in the formation of compound 16 (Scheme 7A; computational evidence for this is given in the supplemental information and Figure S6). The anionic Fries rearrangement57 reaction here then provided important evidence to support the presumed aryl anion intermediate Int2. The activation mode was further validated by the reaction of 19, which can also go through a similar process to afford rearrangement product 3bi (Scheme 7B). The extrusion of the second iodide in Int2 yields the key benzyne species, which is exergonic by 3.5 kcal/mol and easy with an estimated activation energy of 4.7 kcal/mol (no transition state can be located, as demonstrated by a flexible scan of the C-I bond in Int2; see the supplemental information and Figure S3). Overall, NaH-mediated benzyne formation is a favorable process with a calculated activation free energy of 8.1 kcal/mol. This is consistent with the experimental observation that the formation of arynes is carried out under RT reaction conditions. This also agrees with the experimental observation that the weak C-I bond facilitates the elimination of the Nal for aryne formation (Table 1, entries 1 vs. 13-15).\nThe above results are in contrast to those of the procedure of generating benzynes by using strong bases, such as NaNH2, RLi, and RMgX, and a recent example reported by Asako et al. $^{58}$ shows that the aryne generation is often carried out at low reaction temperature $(<-60 ^\\circ\\text{C}).$ The relatively weaker basicity of NaH can efficiently promote I-Na exchange with a weak $C_{sp2}-I$ bond (BDE = 64 kcal/mol). No reaction occurred with o-dibromobenzene substrate, which has the stronger C-Br bond (BDE for $C_{sp2}-$ Br=79 kcal/mol; Table 1, entry 15). In addition, the metal cation $Na^{+}$ is also important for aryne formation. Studies have shown that for a given halogen, the ease of elimination of metal halides is in the order Na>Li>MgBr.59 Homogeneous activation by strong bases (such as NaNH2,RLi,and RMgX)can rapidly accumulate the species, making the reaction messy. In a similar manner to Kobayashi's protocol, 1-6 the high efficiency of aryne-engaged reaction can be ascribed to the low solubility of NaH in THF, which allows for the gradual reaction with o-diiodobenzene to slowly produce o-iodo organometallic intermediate. The suitable alkaline environment created by NaH is particularly unique for uncovering new aryne reactions, as demonstrated by the efficient insertion into an unactivated ketone $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bond with broad functional-group tolerance.\nWe then investigated how the reaction of the resulting benzyne with substrate 2a proceeded to give product 3a and understood the regioselectivity (Schemes 6B and 6C and Figures S7-S11). The formed enolate intermediate, named here as ET, is proposed as a tetrameric aggregate according to Tomasevich and Collum's study.60 The reaction between ET and aryne is a barrierless and irreversible process that forms two possible intermediates, A and B, which give $Na^{+}-$ chelated ketone aryl anions C and D, respectively.

The observed regioselectivity can be rationalized by the model. Both tetramer intermediates A and B can be formed if $R^{S}$ and RL groups in arynes have similar sizes. The degradation or ligand exchange of tetramers delivers the two corresponding monomers C and D, which then furnish two regioisomers, as observed in 4h/h'-4r/r'. However, when the $R^{L}$ group is much bigger than the $R^{S}$ group, steric repulsions make it difficult to generate B in this diffusion-controlled step. Therefore, the single isomer 4g in the reaction of 2a and 1g is observed. This is attributed to the steric repulsion between the large phenyl group (RL) in 1g and the tetrahydrofuran (L) and enolate(R) in B, which leads to the difficult formation of D and therefore the formation of a single isomer, 4g. It should be noted that if a monomeric enolate reacts with aryne, the process is barrierless, and therefore no regiochemistry can be observed (see the supplemental information and Figures S8-S10). This is opposite to the experiments, and therefore this possibility was ruled out.\nIntermediate Int3 then undergoes a Fries-type rearrangement via an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl group to give 4-membered ring intermediate Int4. The activation free energies of 10.5 kcal/mol (via TS2) and 13.8 kcal/mol (via TS3) are required for the formation and opening, respectively, of the 4-membered ring. The ring opening is exergonic by 3.4 kcal/mol to afford Int5, which then converts to final ketone product 3a after protonation in workup. To validate that Int4 is a key intermediate in the process, we prepared a stable benzocyclobutenol, 22, which we then treated with NaH. This compound was smoothly transformed to ketone product 3ae in 83$\\%$ yield (Scheme 7C).61 Our computational results support the fact that anionic ring opening for this process is easier for the generation of the final product than for its neutral process (see Figures $S11-S15).^{62,63}$\nOn the basis of the above studies, we propose a plausible reaction mechanism(Scheme 7D). NaH-mediated nucleophilic attack of hydride to the electrophilic iodine of o-diiodobenzene 1a via transition state 23 gives phenyl anion 24. Then, anion 24 extrudes the second iodide and delivers key benzyne species 25. Nucleophilic enolate 26 in a tetrameric form, engendered by NaH-mediated deprotonation of ketone 2, reacts with the benzyne to give carbanion 27. Finally, intramolecular nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl triggers a Fries-type rearrangement via benzocyclobutenoxide intermediate 28 to afford the final o-alkyl-aryl ketone product 3.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have reinvented aryne chemistry by using \"old\"o-diiodoarenes as aryne progenitors. Distinct from classical methods using strong bases (such as NaNH2,RLi,and RMgX),at low temperature $(<-60 ^\\circ\\text{C})$ in homogeneous solution, a NaH-mediated two-phase reaction in THF at $50 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ enables the generation of the highly active aryne species in a controlled manner. The generated arynes can participate in an efficient $C-C \\space \\sigma -$ bond-insertion reaction with unactivated ketones. The process proceeds highly efficiently with broad functional groups, as evidenced by more than 110 products. Importantly, the protocol can be used for late-stage skeletal editing of structurally complex molecules. The new activation mode for controlling the formation of aryne active species holds significant potential for applications\nto a broad spectrum of novel organic reactions, a proposal that will guide our further efforts in this area. Importantly, understanding how the two adjacent I atoms in the benzyne precursor synergistically generate benzyne is given through DFT calculations, and a new mode of benzyne reaction with tetrameric enolate is proposed to rationalize the observed regioselectivity.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nResource availability\nLead contact\nRequests for further information and resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Shi-Lei Zhang (zhangshilei@suda.edu.cn).\nMaterials availability\nUnique and stable reagents generated in this study will be made available on request, but we might require a payment and/or a completed materials transfer agreement if there is potential for commercial application.\nData and code availability\nThere is no dataset or code associated with the paper.

Here, we report a thorough combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study on the rhodium-/Josiphos-catalyzed intramolecular enantioselective C-H silylation of dihydrosilanes for the construction of silicon-stereogenic centers. A rhodium silyl dihydride complex was identified as the resting state in the catalytic cycle, which was generated via a facile silyl metal migration process. This key resting state was also synthesized and characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the full picture of the mechanism and shed light on the origin of the observed enantioselectivity and the racemization process in the reaction. With the understanding of the mechanism, both enantioenriched tetraorganosilanes and monohydrosilanes could be synthesized with decent yields and enantiomeric excess, respectively.\nINTRODUCTION\nTransition-metal-catalyzed silylation of C-H bonds has developed rapidly over the past two decades, which has emerged as a powerful tool for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. 1-7 Despite remarkable progress has been made in this field, the enantioselective version of C-H silylation is still in its infancy, which has been pursued with particular interest because of the versatile utilities of chiral silicon-containing organic molecules. $^{8-17}$ One of the major challenges facing the development of asymmetric C-H silylation is the lack of information on the mechanism of enantioselective variants of these reactions. To harness this synthetic tool and facilitate access to various enantioenriched organosilanes, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of enantioselective C-H silylation is crucial. In 2017, the Hartwig group reported systematic mechanistic studies on the rhodium-catalyzed intramolecular enantioselective silylation of aryl C-H bonds with monohydrosilanes that gave access to enantioenriched tetraorganosilanes with carbon-stereogenic centers(Scheme 1A, left) $.^{18}$ Arhodium silyl dihydride and a rhodium norbornyl complex were determined to be interconverting catalyst resting states in this asymmetric dehydrogenative coupling reaction. In 2021, He, Yu, Zhang, et al. reported a detailed mechanism on the rhodium-/TMS-Segphos-catalyzed intramolecular enantioselective C-H silylation of silacyclobutanes via combined computational and experimental studies, which constructed enantioenriched tetraorganosilanes with siliconstereogenic centers (Scheme 1A, middle).19\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\nThe enantioselective C-H silylation for the construction of chiral silanes is still in its infancy, which mainly ascribes to the lack of understanding of the mechanism. This work is of great importance for the understanding of catalytic enantioselective C-H silylation with dihydrosilanes, which represents one of the most ideal approaches toward siliconstereogenic silanes. The insights obtained from this work may guide the analysis of the intriguing silicon chirality and inspire further synthetic applications in this field.\n$\\boxed{}$\nIn recent years, the catalytic synthesis of silicon-stereogenic silanes seems to be a hot topic in asymmetric catalysis. $^{9,12,13,20-24}$ Among chiral organosilanes, siliconstereogenic monohydrosilanes, featuring convertible Si-H group on the chiral silicon center, have numerous applications as chiral building blocks, reagents, and auxiliaries, which are highly attractive to chemists. 25 Among various approaches, transition-metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H silylation with dihydrosilanes provides a more efficient and straightforward manner for the synthesis of diverse silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilanes (Scheme 1A, right) $.^{26-31}$ However, it proved to be challenging, given that the obtained monohydrosilane product, having a Si-H group, could further undergo side or over-reaction, such as decomposition, homo-coupling, or redistribution, in the presence of active transition metal catalysts.21 In 2020, our group reported a rhodium-/Josiphos-catalyzed tandem enantioselective aryl C-H silylation/alkene hydrosilylation of dihydrosilanes, which enabled the efficient construction of a range of silicon-stereogenic 9-silafluorenes with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (Scheme 1B, left). 32 Key to the success of this strategy is the one-pot trap of the in situ formed silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilanes with alkenes in a stereospecific fashion, producing the enantioenriched tetrasubstituted 9-silafluorenes. Before that, only one example reported by Takai et al. involved the enantioselective C-H activation of dihydrosilanes, which enabled the construction of tetrasubstituted spirosilabifluorene derivatives via double intramolecular C-H silylation reactions.33,34 Despite the success of the above examples, C-H silylation for the synthesis of enantioenriched silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilanes with high efficiency remains underdeveloped.\nIn our previous study, the monohydrosilane 9-silafluorene product could be obtained in 17$\\%$ yield with 95$\\%$ enantiomeric excess (ee) under the optimized conditions without the use of the alkene partner. $^{32}$ Reinvestigation of this process disclosed that the formed monohydrosilane product racemized in the reaction over time. To fix the problem and further unlock a general platform for the efficient synthesis of silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilanes, it is necessary to understand the racemization process and to elucidate the full picture of the reaction mechanism. Herein, we report our combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies on the rhodium-/Josiphos-catalyzed intramolecular enantioselective C-H silylation of dihydrosilanes. To characterize the structures of the key intermediates, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to perform a detailed analysis of the reaction process. A rhodium silyl dihydride complex was identified as the resting state in the catalytic cycle, which was generated via a facile silyl metal migration process. This key resting state was also synthesized and characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to elucidate the full picture of the mechanism, the origin of the observed enantioselectivity, and the racemization process in the catalytic reaction. With the mechanistic insight into the enantioselective C-H silylation with dihydrosilanes, both enantioenriched tetraorganosilanes and monohydrosilanes could be obtained with decent yields and ee, respectively (Scheme 1B). The use of less hindered alkenes such as 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene produced the silicon-stereogenic tetraorganosilanes via a tandem trap strategy, while, in the presence of norbornene, the silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilane products are efficiently generated.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAt the outset of our studies, the intramolecular C-H silylation of 1a in the absence of alkene was reinvestigated.

We found that the yield of the desired monohydrosilane product 2a gradually increased to 60$\\%$, while the ee of 2a decreased from 86$\\%$ at 0.5 h to 2$\\%$ at 12 h (Figure 1A). It is worth noting that the remaining 1a and product 2a are easily decomposed in the presence of the active Rh catalyst when the reaction mixture was exposed to air. Therefore, rapid separation of them from the Rh catalyst after the reaction is crucial. To understand the racemization process, we propose a primary catalytic cycle as shown in Figure 1B. First, [Rh]-CI species CAT1 is generated from the precursor Rh(cod)CI dimer and (R, Sp)-Josiphos L1, which is further converted to rhodium(l) hydride catalyst CAT2 in the presence of hydrosilane. $^{35,36}$ Next, the active [Rh]-H species (normally the monomer of CAT2) undergoes oxidative addition into one of the Si-H bonds of dihydrosilanes 1a affording intermediate A. Then reductive elimination of dihydrogen from intermediate A generates a Rh(I) silyl complex $B,^{37}$ which subsequently undergoes C-H bond activation, giving intermediate C. Finally, reductive elimination of intermediate C furnishes the monohydrosilane product 2a and completes the catalytic cycle. Although this mechanism seems reasonable, several problems have been plaguing us. For example, why did the monohydrosilane product 2a racemize in the reaction? What is the active catalytic species? What is the enantio-determining step? Can we fix the problem to get 2a in high yield and enantioselectivity? We thus strived to decode the puzzle and to further unlock a general platform for the efficient synthesis of silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilanes.\nCharacterization of the catalyst resting states\nTo gain information on the catalytic species in the process, the silylation of 1a conducted with 8 mol $\\%$[Rh(cod)Cl]2 and 16 mol $\\%$ L1 in toluene-d8 was monitored by $^{31}P$ NMR at $60 ^\\circ\\text{C} .$ In the first half hour, we observed one phosphine-ligated rhodium species consisted of two doublets of doublets at 101.3 ppm $(dd, \\space J_{Rh-P}=140.2$ Hz, $J_{P-P}=32.3$ Hz,PtBu2)and29.0ppm $(dd,J_{Rh-P}=137.1$ Hz, $J_{P-P}=32.4$ Hz,PPh2)(Figure 2, purple line). As the reaction progressed, another analogous phosphineligated rhodium species was gradually generated, which displayed two doublets of doublets at 101.5 ppm $(dd, \\space J_{Rh-P}=140.5$ Hz, $J_{P-P}=32.5$ Hz, PtBu2) and 29.1 ppm $(dd,J_{Rh-P}=137.3$ Hz, $J_{P-P}=32.3$ Hz, $PPh_{2})($ Figure2,greenlineat8.5h; see Figure S1 for more details). The timeline for the formation of the second phosphine-ligated rhodium species seems parallel with the racemization process, which encourages us to further identify the structures of these Rh catalytic species via stoichiometric reactions.\nSince cyclohexadiene (cod) can act as a hydrogen acceptor if using [Rh(cod)CI]2 as the rhodium source in the stoichiometric reactions with 1a, to eliminate this interference, the corresponding [Rh]-CI species CAT1 was first synthesized by the reaction of [Rh(cod)Cl]2 with (R,Sp)-Josiphos L1. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B (left), CAT1 was obtained in 96$\\%$ yield as a dimeric form characterized by X-ray crystallography. Further treatment of CAT1 with stoichiometric 1a produced a yellow solid complex D in 92$\\%$ yield (Figure 3A, top right), and interestingly, $whose^{31}P$ NMR signals were matched with the initial phosphine-ligated rhodium species in the catalytic reaction(Figure 2, purple line). After many efforts, the structure of complex D was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 3B, right), in which the Si-C bond has already formed, and the silicon-stereogenic center has also been constructed with an (R) absolute configuration. Complex D contains a distorted square-based-pyramidal geometry, in which two phosphorus atoms and two hydrides form the square base, while the silyl group occupies the axial position. The distortion from the square-based pyramid is revealed by the hydride-rhodium-silicon angles\n$(49^{\\circ}$ and $52^{\\circ}),$ which are much smaller than the idealized $90^{\\circ}.$ The distances between the silicon and the two hydrides differ significantly (1.81 and 1.87 A). In addition, the H NMR spectrum of the pure complex D exhibited a broad signal of two rhodium hydrides at -6.397 ppm, which was fully resolved into two sharp signals at $-40 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ (Figure 3C).\nSince complex D is identified as the first phosphine-ligated rhodium species in the catalytic reaction (Figure 2, purple line), we were then more curious about the structure of the gradually formed Rh-P species (Figure 2, green line at 8.5 h; see Figure S1 for more details). Given its $similar^{31}P$ NMR pattern with complex D, and the racemization outcome of the silicon-stereogenic silane product, we speculated that they are a pair of diastereomers with the opposite configuration of the silicon-stereogenic center. To confirm this hypothesis, complex D', featuring (S) configuration at silicon, was prepared by the reaction of CAT1 with 1b (Figure 3A, bottom right). Indeed, the $^{31}P$ NMR signals of complex D' matched perfectly with the second phosphineligated rhodium species (Figure 2, red line, compared with green line). These results indicate that complex D and D' are the resting states in the catalytic cycle, and the racemization of the silicon-stereogenic center relates to the formation of complex D'.\nComputational study of the formation of complex D and the origin of\nenantioselectivity\nWith the above findings in hand, DFT calculations were used to provide insight into the mechanism of the formation of rhodium silyl dihydride complex D and the origin of enantioselectivity (see Supporting Information for details). The complete free energy profile for the formation of complex D is presented in Figure 4A (blue pathway for(R)-complex D, and purple pathway for (S)-complex D'). In general, the process starts with the dissociation of CAT2 to the monomer [Rh]-H species. Subsequently, the reaction proceeds with Si-H oxidative addition and dehydrogenation to afford Rh(I)\nspecies, followed by C-H bond activation and subsequent silyl metal migration to afford complex D. The oxidative addition of the Si-H bond of dihydrosilane 1a to[Rh]-H species (normally the monomer of CAT2) was computed to occur via a three-center transition state TS1 with a small barrier of 0.6 kcal/mol. The INT1 could then undergo reductive elimination via TS2 to form INT3 with the release of a molecule H2. The dehydrogenation process for the conversion to INT3 is endothermic with 8.6 kcal/mol of free energy from INT1. Subsequent C-H bond activation from INT3 took place via the oxidative addition transition state TS3, with a free energy barrier of 15.3 kcal/mol to\nform a six-membered rhodacycle INT4. Next, Si-C bond reductive elimination occurred via TS4 with an energy barrier of 7.2 kcal/mol, followed by a rapid oxidative addition without an energy barrier, leading to the generation of the stable complex D instead of releasing the monohydrosilane product 2a. This continuous process can be regarded as a unique silyl metal migration in the catalytic cycle.\nFor the origin of the initial enantioselectivity, we found that the relative free energy for the purple pathway is higher than that of the blue pathway, thus, the generation of(R)-complex D is more favored than (S)-complex D', which is consistent with the experimental observations. The C-H oxidative addition process is identified as the enantiodetermining step toward complex D in the overall process. The generation of (R)-complex D via TS3 is kinetically favored over the formation of (S)-complex D' via TS3' by 3.2kcal/mol in terms offree energies (Figure 4B). To further elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity, we performed a distortion/interaction analysis for the C-H transition state geometries. 38 The activation energy $(\\Delta E^{\\dagger})$ was decomposed into the distortion energy $(\\Delta E^{\\dagger}$ dist) of the two fragments Josiphos L1 and Rh-1a, and interaction energy $(\\Delta E^{\\dagger}_{int}$ between them. The distortion energy of TS3 is 3.8 kcal/mol higher than that of TS3', while the interaction energies $(\\Delta \\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{int}=6.2$ kcal/mol) are enough to compensate for the unfavored distortions. The $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{dist}/ \\Delta E^{\\ddagger}$ int analysis of the transition states suggests that the observed stereoselectivity can be ascribed to the greater $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{int}$ between Josiphos ligand and dihydrosilane, which is in favor of TS3. For other chiral ligands, such as BINAP and Segphos, further DFT calculations showed that the $\\Delta E$ of these two transition states in the C-H activation reaction were almost identical, which indicated their lack of selectivity (see Supporting Information for details).\nInvestigations for the racemization process\nWith the isolated complex D in hand, the reactivity of which was investigated to assess the relevance of this complex in the catalytic system (Figure 5A), the reaction of 1a catalyzed by complex D resulted in the formation of 2a in 50$\\%$ yield with 50$\\%$ ee in 4 h. The yield and ee of this reaction matched with the catalytic reaction directly using [Rh(cod) CI]2 and L1 (Figure 1A, at 4 h). This result indicates that complex D participates in the catalytic cycle. To gain more information for the racemization of the monohydrosilane product 2a, several control experiments were conducted. Heating enantioenriched 2a(in 94$\\%$ ee) at $60 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 24 h, the ee was unchanged. However, in the presence of 16 mol$\\%$complexD,a22$\\%$reductionoftheeeof2awasobserved(Figure5B).Inaddition, when heating the pure complex D(>99$\\%$ diastereomeric excess [de]) at $60 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 24 h, the de value decreased to 80$\\%$ (Figure 5C). These results together suggest that the racemization is caused by the interaction of 2a with the rhodium silyl dihydride species complex D, and complex D itself also can racemize to complex D'.\nBased on the above observations, we proposed three possible mechanisms for the racemization from complex D (Figure 5D). Path A is a Berry-pseudorotation mechanism via a five-coordinate geometry along the Rh-Si bond rotation.39 The estimated calculated electronic energy barrier for the complex D internal rotation is 45.9 kcal/mol, which is an unfavored process toward racemization. In path B, the homolysis cleavages of Rh-Si bond from complex D would lead to the generation of two radicals, which presumably would cause racemization. The reaction energetic span for this process was calculated to be 61.5 kcal/mol, which is extremely high and would not occur under mild conditions. In alternative path C, another silyl metal migration of complex D (Si-H reductive elimination of complex D toward 2a and [Rh]-H, followed by the oxidative addition of the Si-Ph bond of 2a to [Rh]-H via TS6) afforded INT5. Then reductive elimination of the Si-H bond in INT5 (via TS7) provided a prochiral INT6 and [Rh]-Ph species. After that, the unselective oxidative\naddition of either Si-H bond in prochiral INT6 to [Rh]-Ph species (via TS7 or TS7'), followed by reductive elimination (via TS6 or TS6') resulted in the racemization of silicon-stereogenic center, leading to the formation of complex D' (Figure 5E). The overall activation free energy of this process from complex D is 30.7 kcal/mol, which implies that path C is more favorable than paths A and B.\nEnantioselective C-H silylation in the presence of alkenes\nTo avoid racemization of the newly formed monohydrosilane product, previously we demonstrated a tandem strategy allowing the one-pot trap of the in situ formed silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilanes with alkenes, giving access to the\nenantioenriched tetrasubstituted silicon-stereogenic silanes. $^{32}$ When dihydrosilane 1a was treated with 2mol$\\%$[Rh(cod)Cl]2 and 4mol$\\%$(R,Sp)-Josiphos L1 in the presence of 2.0 equiv of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene 5, a tetrasubstituted silicon-stereogenic 9-silafluorene 3a was obtained in 70$\\%$ yield with 90$\\%$ ee (Figure 6A, 1). In addition, the reaction of 1a catalyzed by complex D resulted in the formation of 3a in a similar ee with a slightly lower yield (Figure 6A,2). These results suggest that complex D also participates in the catalytic cycle with the use of alkene 5.\nmonohydrosilanes with both high yield and ee is still challenging. To solve this problem, we further explored the mechanism of the enantioselective C-H silylation in the presence of alkenes. As shown in Figure 6B (blue lines), alkene 5 insertion with complex D occurs via transition state TS8 with a free energy barrier of 28.3 kcal/mol to give INT7. Subsequent facile Si-C reductive elimination via transition state TS9 affords the corresponding tetrasubstituted silane product 3a and [Rh]-H species. The calculated free energy barrier of this step was only 13.4 kcal/mol from INT7. Alternatively, the Si-H reductive elimination of INT7 could occur to give the monohydrosilane 2a, in which the calculated relative free energy of transition state TS10 is 3.0 kcal/mol lower than that of TS9, which would reversibly form INT8. However, we found that the calculated free energy barrier of hydrogenation of INT8 to generate [Rh]-H species is 21.8 kcal/mol, which reveals that Si-H reductive elimination from INT7 is unfavorable.\nBased on the current studies of the mechanism, we realized that, to rapidly access monohydrosilane product with the assistance of alkene additive, increasing the steric hindrance of the alkene motif might be beneficial for Si-H reductive elimination rather than Si-C reductive elimination from the corresponding key intermediate INT7. With this idea in mind, the commonly used bulky alkene norbornene 6 was further investigated as additive by DFT calculation (Figure 6B, red lines). The insertion of norbornene 6 into complex D requires an activation barrier of 24.1 kcal/mol. Due to the steric effects, the relative free energy of Si-C reductive elimination via TS17 is increased by 7.2 kcal/mol compared with the corresponding steps using 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene 5. The activation free energy of TS17 is 5.4 and 4.7 kcal/mol higher than that of TS14 and TS16, respectively; therefore, the generation of monohydrosilane 2a is more favored than the formation of tetrasubstituted silane 4a.\nGuided by computational investigations, we next conducted the experimental studies of this intramolecular C-H silylation of 1a in the presence of 1.5 equiv of norbornene 6 under the standard catalytic conditions for 2 h. To our delight, the desired monohydrosilane 2a was obtained in 65$\\%$ yield with 90$\\%$ ee (Figure 6A, 3), and the by-product of tetrasubstituted silane 4a could be detected in a less than 10$\\%$ yield. When using complex D as the catalyst, 2a could also be obtained in 65$\\%$ yield with 86$\\%$ ee (Figure 6B,4).\nMeasurement of the kinetic isotope effect\nIn the presence of norbornene 6, two parallel kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments were carried out using 1a and 1a-d5, as shown in Figure 7A. The reactions gave rise to a $k_{H}/k_{D}$ value of 1.2, which indicates that C-H bond cleavage may not be the ratedetermining step. In addition, the same-flask intermolecular competition experiment was conducted with 1a and 1a-d5 as the substrates (Figure 7B). A ratio of 3.6:1 (C-H versus C-D activation) was observed. Furthermore, we measured an intramolecular KIE, in which the reaction of $1a-d_{1}$ gave a mixture of $3a-d_{1}$ and 3a in a 2.0:1 ratio (Figure 7C). These results together suggest that the C-H bond activation is irreversible but is not the rate-determining step. 40 Two parallel KIE experiments in the absence of hydrogen acceptors were also carried out. In contrast, the $k_{H}/k_{D}$ value is 1.8 (see Figure S14 in Supporting Information for details). This result indicates that C-H bond cleavage may be the rate-determining step in this condition, which is consistent with the DFT calculations (Figure 4A).\nProposed mechanism\nOn the basis of the results described above, we proposed an updated mechanism for this rhodium-catalyzed enantioselective C-H silylation process (Figure 7D).\nInitially, the active [Rh]-H species (normally the monomer of CAT2) undergoes oxidative addition into one of the Si-H bonds of 1a, affording intermediate A. Then reductive elimination of dihydrogen from A generates a Rh(I) silyl intermediate B. The release of H2 could be detected $by^{1}H$ NMR via passing the gas atmosphere of the reaction into tol $-d_{8}$ (Figure S13). Intermediate B subsequently undergoes enantioselective C-H bond activation, affording intermediate C. After that, reductive elimination of intermediate C occurs to form the C-Si bond and Rh(I) hydride species, which instantly proceeds oxidative addition into the second Si-H bond, furnishing complex D. This continuous process from C to D can be regarded as a unique silyl metal migration in the catalytic cycle. In the absence of alkene, monohydrosilans 2a can be generated by the direct reductive elimination from complex D, but racemization of 2a is facile.

In contrast, the use of steric hindered norbornene 6 enables efficient access to silicon-stereogenic monohydrosilane 2a with both high yield and enantioselectivity.\nSubstrate scope\nTo show a general applicability of this mechanistic work, the substrate scope of this rhodium-/Josiphos-catalyzed intramolecular enantioselective C-H silylation was further explored (Figure 8). To facilitate the purification of the final products, a modified NBE-OMe (5-(methoxymethyl)bicyclo-[2.2.1]hept-2-ene) was selected as the hydrogen acceptor. The desired product 2a could be obtained in 68$\\%$ yield with 92$\\%$ ee. Biaryl dihydrosilane substrates bearing Ph, tBu, and Cl groups on the aromatic ring all reacted smoothly to afford the enantioenriched monohydrosilanes in good yields with high enantioselectivities (2b-2e). Changing the other substituents on the silicon atom into functionalized aromatic rings, benzofuran, aliphatic butyl and cyclohexyl groups also produced the corresponding products in good yields without the loss of enantioselectivities (2f-2l).\nConclusion\nThe mechanism of a rhodium-catalyzed intramolecular enantioselective C-H silylation of dihydrosilanes for the synthesis of silicon-stereogenic silanes was investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. A rhodium silyl dihydride complex was identified as the resting state in the catalytic cycle, which was generated via a facile silyl metal migration process. DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate the full picture of the mechanism and shed light on the origin of the observed enantioselectivity and the racemization process in the reaction. Based on the mechanistic study, this work provides the tandem trap strategy and steric control strategy to realize the synthesis of silicon-stereogenic tetraorganosilanes and monohydrosilanes with high efficiency, respectively. This work represents a rare systematic mechanistic study on the enantioselective C-H silylation of dihydrosilanes toward siliconstereogenic silanes, and we believed that insights obtained from this work may guide the analysis of the intriguing silicon chirality and inspire further synthetic applications of this methodology.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nResource availability\nLead contact\nFurther information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Chuan He (hec@sustech.edu.cn).\nMaterials availability\nAll materials generated in this study are available from the lead contact without restriction.\nData and code availability\nSmall-molecule crystallography data for CAT1 and complex D have been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center under identifier CCDC: 2219161 and 2219160.

Both coupling reactions provided axially chiral diaryl dicarboxylates, which are useful subunits of bioactive molecules and chiral catalysts, with high to excellent enantioselectivities. Further control experiments and DFT calculations accounted for a possible reason for a successful cross-coupling. A stereocontrol model involving the formation of a dual N-H hydrogen bond between the ligand and naphthyl triflate was also suggested based on the calculation results.\nKeywords\ncross-coupling, asymmetric catalysis, axial chirality, diaryl dicarboxylate, ligand\nIntroduction\nDicarboxylate acids and their derivatives with an axially chiral biaryl scaffold exist in a number of bioactive molecules and natural products,1-9 as represented by a-DDB for the treatment of hepatic disease and corilagin, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (Figure $1a).^{10,11}$ In addition, these axially chiral compounds have also found wide applications in asymmetric catalysis, functioning as capable hydrogen-bonding donor catalysts in organocatalysis, effective counter-anion co-catalysts in dual catalysis, and essential ligands in enantioselective C-H functionalization reactions (Figure $1b).^{12-17}$\na) Representative bioactive molecules with an axially chiral diaryl dicarboxylate\nThe versatile utilities of these chiral biaryl compounds have piqued continuous research efforts toward their synthesis. 18-29 Apart from optical resolution methods to access these valuable dicarboxylate acids, 30-35 a chiral auxiliary strategy that exploits an intramolecular Ullmann coupling of axially chiral diesters was also reported. $^{36,37}$ These protocols often require multi-step transformations, rendering the overall synthesis procedure rather tedious. $^{38,39}$ Therefore, the development of direct catalytic atroposelective couplings of easily accessible aryl carboxylate acid derivatives is highly appealing. In this regard, pioneering studies from Tang's group documented an asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura cross- $coupling^{40-45}$ for the preparation of biaryl dials, while Xu and $Lin^{\\prime}s,^{46}Mei^{\\prime}s,^{47}$ and $Li^{\\prime}s^{49}$ groups demonstrated the capability of reductive homo-coupling for the enantioselective synthesis of these atropisomers, providing efficient entries into either axially chiral biaryl dials or biaryl esters.\nDespite these breakthroughs, the reactions have primarily centered on the homo-coupling of ortho-halide aryl aldehydes and esters, which enables the synthesis of only symmetrical biaryls (Scheme 1a). To acquire chiral diaryl dicarboxylate derivatives with unsymmetric substitution, the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling still provides the only synthetic solution. Research of the catalytic asymmetric reductive cross-coupling of aryl electrophiles is in its infancy due to difficulties associated with suppressing the homo-coupling of electrophiles with marginal differences in electronic properties and controlling the stereoselectivity.\na) Catalytic asymmetric reductive couplings of aryl electrophiles\nNi-catalyzed enantioselective reactions for the formation of $Csp^{2}- Csp^{3}$ or $Csp^{3}- Csp^{3}$ bond have been welldocumented. $^{50-59}$ These Ni catalysts are also found to excel in catalyzing reductive homo-coupling for the construction $Csp^{2}- Csp^{2}$ bond. $^{60}$ Herein, aiming to develop an effective enantioselective approach to access unsymmetrical biaryls, we achieved the Ni/ $SPDO^{61-64}$ catalyzed highly enantioselective cross-coupling reactions between ortho-triflate and ortho-bromide aryl esters (Scheme 1b). The slight discrepancy for oxidative addition of these electrophiles with Ni-catalyst is responsible for a successful transformation. Furthermore, the current system is also capable of catalyzing the reductive homo-coupling of ortho-triflate aryl esters, signifying a more general substrate scope and enhanced enantioselectivity.\nExperimental Methods\nGeneral procedure for enantioselective reductive cross-coupling\nC 2024 Chinese Chemical Society.\nIn an argon-filled glovebox, to a sealed tube was charged with $NiBr_{2}.$ DME (2.8 mg, 0.009 mmol), chiral SPDO ligand L6 (6.2 mg, 0.018 mmol), CoPc (4.0 mg, 0.007 mmol), Et4NI (51.4 mg, 0.2 mmol), Zn dust (20.6 mg, 0.315 mmol), naphthyl triflates 1 (0.1 mmol), aryl bromides 2 (0.2 mmol) was added THF (0.8 mL). The reaction tube was sealed with a rubber septum, and removed from the glove box. The reaction tube was stirred at $50^{\\circ}C$ for 20 h. After a quick filtration of the reaction mixture through a silica gel powder pad to remove the residue, the reaction mixture was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography to furnish the desired product. Further details, see Supporting Information.\nGeneral procedure for enantioselective reductive homo-coupling\nIn an argon-filled glovebox, to a sealed tube was charged with $NiBr_{2}.$ DME (2.5 mg, 0.008 mmol), chiral SPDO ligand L6 (5.5 mg, 0.016 mmol), CoPc (5.7 mg, 0.01 mmol), $Et_{4}$ NI (51.4 mg, 0.2 mmol), Zn dust (6.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), naphthyl triflates 1 (0.1 mmol) was added EtOAc (0.8 mL). The reaction tube was sealed with a rubber septum, and removed from the glove box. The reaction tube was stirred at $50^{\\circ}C$ for 24 h. After a quick filtration of the reaction mixture through a silica gel powder pad to remove the residue, the reaction mixture was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography to furnish the desired product. Further details, see Supporting Information.\nResults and Discussion\nOptimization of reaction conditions\nIn our initial evaluations, 3-fluoride-5-methyl phenol ester was found to be optimal for the cross-coupling reaction with respect to the product yield. Further screening of phenol esters revealed that lower yield and enantioselectivity were observed when other substituted phenols were employed. For more details, please see Table S3 in Supporting Information. Thus, naphthyl triflate 1a and aryl bromide 2a were selected as model substrates to investigate the coupling reaction (Table 1). After screening different reaction parameters including Ni salts, ligands, additives, reductants, solvents, and temperatures, we identified NiBr $2 \\cdot$ DME with the SPDO ligand L6 as an optimal catalyst. When combined with Zn dust as the reductant and CoPc and Et4NI as additives, the reaction carried out in THF at $50 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ provided the desired cross-coupling product 3a in 71$\\%$ yield with 90$\\%$ ee (entry 6). A series of dinitrogen ligands substantially reduced the reactivity of the cross-coupling reaction, producing 3a in low yields (entries 1-5). The Ni salts exhibited a noticeable influence on the product yield and enantioselectivity. Other Ni(II) catalysts significantly deceased the yield but only had a slight influence on the enantioselectivity (entries 7-11). In some cases, low levels of stereocontrol were observed. Notably, the reductant and solvent also play crucial roles in the reactivity (entries 12-20). A generally low yield or no conversion was observed when using other reductants, such as Mn or TDAE, or solvents (entries 12-15), and use of aryl chloride would lead to a failed cross-coupling reaction with no 3a observed. Notably, even in the optimal conditions, the competitive homo-coupling of both aryl bromides and naphthyl triflates could not be suppressed. The biaryl and binaphthyl products were obtained in 52$\\%$ and 9$\\%$ yield, respectively. 65-76\n\\begin{matrix} N i s a l t ( 9 \\space m o l $\\%$ ) \\\\ L i g a n d ( 1 8 \\space m o | $\\%$ ) \\\\ C o P c ( 7 \\space m o | $\\%$ ) \\end{matrix}\n$CO_{2}Ar^{1}$\n$CO_{2}Ar$MeO$CO_{2}Ph$OTf$Et_{4}$ NI(2 equiv)\n$Ar^{1}=3-F-5-$ Me-Ph\nreductant (3.15 equiv)\n1a\n2a\nsolvent,temp.,20h\n3a\nWith the optimal conditions in hand, we explored the substrate scope of the reductive cross-coupling (Table 2). The aryl substitution of the phenolic ester of 2 was first varied. Regardless of either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at the o-, m-, or p-positions of the arene, the coupling products were afforded with high enantioselectivities (3b-3h). An electron deficient phenolic ester resulted in a relatively low yield of product (3e). Next, the scope of naphthyl triflate was investigated. Generally, the substitution at various positions on naphthalene was allowed with marginal influence on the enantioselection of the coupling reaction(3i-3q) except for 3j and 3q with a C4 or C7 methoxy substituent. In these cases, the products would be furnished with slightly decreased enantioselectivities. A noticeable decrease in the yield was also observed in nearly all cases, especially for substrates with C6 or C7 substitution (3n-3o). The competitive homo-coupling and dehalogenation reactions would predominate in these examples.\nFurthermore, the substitution patterns of aryl bromides were then evaluated (3r-3y). An alkoxyl group at the ortho-position of bromide was necessary to guarantee a high level of enantioselection. Replacement with a fluoride or methyl group resulted in a notable decrease in enantioselectivity (3r and 3s), whereas alternation of the ether group from methoxy to ethoxy, isopropoxy, or MOMO was well-tolerated (3t-3v). In particular, a meta-fluoride or methoxy substituent was detrimental to the reaction, providing 3w or 3y in low yields with only moderate enantioselectivity.\nScope of enantioselective reductive homo-coupling\nDespite recent reports on the reductive homo-coupling of ortho-bromo aryl or naphthyl esters, the enantioselectivity of the phenolic ester was moderate. $^{47,48}$ By changing the solvent from THF to EtOAc, the adjusted standard conditions could be applied in the reductive homo-couplings of ortho-ester naphthyl triflates or aryl bromides. $^{77,78}$ As shown in Table 3, dinaphthyl dicarboxylates 4a and 4b exhibited high to excellent enantioselectivity. For phenyl bromides 2a and 2j, the reactions proceeded with high efficiency and generated 4c and 4d, respectively, with comparable enantioselectivities.\nThe ester groups have a significant impact on the coupling reactions of naphthyl triflates. Similarly, 3-fluoride-5methyl phenol ester was found to be optimal for enhancing both the yields and enantioselectivities (See the Supporting Information). Substitutions at various naphthalene positions were quite compatible. These include methyl, phenyl, methoxy, cyclopropyl groups, and halides. Generally, high yields with excellent enantioselectivities were obtained in all cases, except for 6-chloro-naphthyl triflate. The relatively low yield of 4n was partially attributed to competitive dechlorination.\n$\\frac{NiBr_{2}\\cdot DME(8 \\space mol $\\%$)}{L6(16(mo/ $\\%$)}\\\\$ CoP(10mo)$\\%$)\n$CO_{2}R^{2}\\\\ CO_{2}R^{C}$\n$Et_{4}$ NI(2 equiv) Zn (1 equiv)\n1\nEtOAc, $50 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,24h$\n4\nSynthetic applications\nAn axially chiral diaryl dicarboxylates are useful precursors for other atropoenriched compounds. As shown in Scheme 2, the hydrolysis of axially chiral diester 3a provides diaryl dicarboxylate acid 5 with disparate aryl substitutions, whereas the reduction of diester 4u would results in diol 6 with maintained enantioselectivity. In both cases, the absolute configurations of derivatives 5 and 6 were confirmed through X-ray diffraction analysis of their single crystals. Further application of dicarboxylate 7 in asymmetric propargylic substitution reaction was shown in Scheme 2c. An improvement of enantioselectivity was observed when its sodium salt was used as a chiral counteranion.79\na) Hydrolysis of cross-coupling product 3a\n$CO_{2}Ar^{1}$\nNaOH MeO $CO_{2}Ph$\n$\\xrightarrow [THF, \\space rt]{}$ MeO 3a 90$\\%$ ee\n91$\\%$,88$\\%$ ee\nX-ray structure of 5\nb) Reduction of homo-coupling product 4u\n$LiAIH_{4}$\n$CO_{2}$ Ph\\\\C $O_{2}Ph$\nOH\n$\\xrightarrow [THF,0 ^\\circ\\text{C} ]{}$\n$\\equiv$\nOH\n4u90$\\%$ ee\n6\\\\93$\\%$, 89$\\%$ ee\nX-ray structure of 6\nc) Chiral sodium carboxylate 7 in asymmetric catalysis\nCI、\n$CO_{2}H$\nNaOH\n$CO_{2}Na$\nMeO、\n$CO_{2}H$\n$\\overset{\\rightarrow}{DCM/MeOH, \\space rt}$\nMeO.\n$CO_{2}Na$\nMeo\n$\\Pr _{PPh_{2}}$\n5\n7,98$\\%$\n(S)-CI-MeO-BIPHEP\n$OCO_{2}Me$\nMe\nPh\nNi(COD $)_{2}(10$ mol $$\\%$)\\\\ \\space \\frac{(S)-Cl-MeO-BIPHEP(12mol $\\%$)}{7(10mol $\\%$)\\\\ diixane,15 ^\\circ\\text{C}}$\ndioxane, $15 ^\\circ\\text{C}$\nMe\n8\nPh 10\n(1) without 7:79$\\%$, 89$\\%$ ee (2) with 7: 74$\\%$, 95$\\%$ ee\nMechanistic studies\nFurther experiments were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism (See the Supporting Information). The relative reactivity of naphthyl triflate 1a and aryl bromide 2a was investigated by subjecting both 1a and 1 equivalent of 2a into the standard reaction conditions. After 1 hour, the reaction was imediately quenched for analysis. The higher yields of homo-coupling product 4c and direct reduction product 12 than those of 4a and 11 indicated the propensity of the Ni catalyst to first react with the aryl bromide 2a via an oxidative addition. In addition, according to radical trapping experimental results, the possible direct radical coupling pathway was excluded. $^{49,80}$ The X-ray analysis of a single crystal structure of the Ni/SPDO complex 13 and the ligand L6, the SPDO liganded to Ni(II) through bidentate coordination may be effective in the catalytic cycle. Cyclic voltammetry of this Ni/SPDO complex 13 shows the reductive potential of Ni(II)/Ni(I) and Ni(I)/Ni(O) vs Fc+/ $Fc^{0}$ in THF to be -1.34 and -1.65 V, respectively, which are nearly consistent with previous reports on Ni complexes with Pyrox ligands. $^{47,81}$ Acontrol reaction with this complex 13 as the catalyst also afforded 3a in a slightly decreased yield and enantioselectivity.\n$CO_{2}Ar^{1}$\nMeo\n$CO_{2}$ Ph\\\\C $O_{2}Ph$\n$\\begin{matrix}1a(1 \\space equiv)&NiBr_{2}\\cdot DME,L6 \\\\ 2a \\space(1 \\space equiv)\\\\ Et_{4}Nl,COPC,Zn \\\\ THF,50 ^\\circ\\text{C} ,1h \\end{matrix}$\n4a,1$\\%$\n4c,16$\\%$ MeO 3a,4$\\%$\n$CO_{2}$ Ar1\n$CO_{2}Ph$\n11,0$\\%$\\\\95$\\%$ of 1a recovered\n12,11$\\%$\\\\63$\\%$ of 2a recovered\n$\\frac{NiBr_{2}\\cdot DME}{THF,rtto \\space 65 ^\\circ\\text{C}}$\n$\\equiv$\nPh\nPh\nX-ray structure of 13\n$\\frac{13(9mmol $\\%$)}{CoPc(7mmo| $\\%$)}$ MeO $CO_{2}Ar^{1^{1}}$ OTf $Et_{4}$ Ni(2 qquiv)\n$Ar^{1}=3-F-5-$ Me-Ph\n2a\nZn (3.15 equiv)\\\\THF, $50 ^\\circ\\text{C} C,20h$\n3a\\\\54$\\%$,79$\\%$ ee\nDFT calculations were performed to provide further insights of the mechanism on both the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the cross-coupling reaction.80 The energy barrier of the oxidative addition of naphthyl triflate 1a was calculated to be 8.5 kcal/mol, which was 5.6 kcal/mol higher than that of the oxidative addition of aryl bromide 2a. This outcome is consistent with the experimental results that the aryl bromide is more reactive with the catalyst than the triflate. As suggested in Figure 2, formation of a dual hydrogen bond between the N and H atom of the catalyst and the ester and triflate groups of naphthyl triflate was found to be responsible for the generation of enantioselectivity. A lower energy barrier for the second oxidative addition was calculated for transition state TS $2_{R}$ than that of TS2s. In former case, the coupling product 3a with R configuration was obtained.\nBased on control experiments, literature reports, and DFT calculations, a catalytic mechanism was proposed.47- $^{49,80}$ The reduction of the Ni(II) salt by zinc dust generated a Ni(0) catalyst 14. The oxidative addition of aryl bromide with Ni(O) produced a Ni(II) complex 15. The ensuing reduction of this complex to Ni(I) intermediate 16 followed by a second oxidative addition would give biaryl Ni(III) intermediate 17, whose reductive elimination finally afforded the product 3a and regenerated the catalyst 18.\nConclusion\nSupporting Information\nSupporting Information is available and includes experimental procedures, characterization data of the compounds.\nConflict of Interest\nThere is no conflict of interest to report.\nFunding Information\nWe thank the NSFC (No.22278200,21971095,21502080,21772019,21772076,21871117,91956203),the\"111\" Program of MOE, the Major project (2018ZX09711001-005-002) of MOST, and the STCSM (19JC1430100) for their financial support.\nReferences\n1.

This electrochemical approach offers a robust route for synthesizing diverse malononitrile derivatives featuring quaternary carbon centers and incorporating paraphenol groups. Notably, the direct electrooxidation of the C( $sp^{3})-H$ bond in the para-cresol derivative plays a crucial role in this process under electrolytic conditions. Various para-cresol derivatives and malononitrile derivatives with different substituents are readily compatible with this electrochemical transformation, affording coupling compounds in up to 99$\\%$ yield.\nKey words electrochemical oxidation, cross-coupling, para-cresol derivatives, malononitrile derivatives, C( $sp^{3})-C(sp^{3})$ bonds\nMalononitrile compounds are diverse and abundant, serving as crucial building blocks for a variety of bioactive molecules with applications in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dyes. For instance, tyrphostin A9, a malononitrile derivative, acts as an inhibitor of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor1 and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for anticancer purposes.2 Snider and co-workers also identified a malononitrile derivative as an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK $2).^{3}$ Additionally, these compounds play a crucial role as key ingredients in the production of sulfonylurea herbicides such as $bensulfuron^{4}$ and pyrazosulfuron-methyl.5 Tang and co-workers developed malononitrile derivatives(TCF-DNs) as dual-function probes for recognizing H2S and $HSO_{3}-$ in biological environments and industrial production(Scheme $1a).^{6}$ Notably, the cyano group in malononitrile is a versatile functional group in organic synthesis, capable of being transformed into different functional groups and heterocycles, including carboxylic acids, aldehydes, amines, and oxazolines.10 Therefore, the development of efficient methods for synthesizing malononitrile-based molecules is crucial for advancements in pharmaceutical chemistry and organic synthesis.\npara-Substituted phenols are key structural units in a wide variety of natural products [e.g., (-)-catechin,11 the main functional ingredient in tea]. Their derivatives exhibit remarkable bioactivity and find extensive applications in both the $pharmaceutical^{12}$ and $pesticide^{13}$ fields, exempli-\n$\\checkmark$\nB\nPaper\nfied by the antipyretic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic $acetaminophen^{14}$ and the herbicide bromoxynil(Scheme $1b).^{15}$ Oxidative C-H/X-H cross-coupling presents an efficient method for constructing substituted phenols, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization of the substrate.16 However, the conventional oxidative cross-coupling process for functionalizing C( $sp^{3})-H$ bonds in parasubstituted phenols typically relies on stoichiometric chemical oxidant such as copper salts or Oxone. $^{17}$\nElectrochemistry has gained significant attention for its potential in the discovery of innovative synthetic transformations.18 In contrast to traditional organic chemistry, electrochemistry eliminates the need for toxic oxidants and reductants by leveraging electron transfer at electrodes.19 Consequently, electrochemical synthesis has rapidly advanced in recent years, especially in the functionalization of C( $sp^{3})-H$ bonds.20 Notably,Waldvogel's research group introduced a highly efficient electrochemical method for functionalizing phenol derivative C( $sp^{3})-H$ bonds, offering a novel route for modifying phenol derivatives.21 Our team has focused on electrochemical methods for the oxidative cross-coupling of para-substituted phenol C( $sp^{3})-H,^{22}$ utilizing Lewis acids or organocatalysts for enantioselective synthesis of phenol derivatives.23 Additionally, Xu and coworkers presented a direct electrooxidation approach for mono- and dialkylation of phenol derivative C( $sp^{3})-H,^{24}$ providing a blueprint for environmentally friendly assembly of para-substituted phenols through electrochemical means.\nMotivated by these significant studies, we have developed an innovative C( $sp^{3})-H$ coupling approach for the efficient synthesis of malononitrile derivatives with para-substituted phenols in a cost-effective manner (Scheme 1c). Noteworthy aspects of our research include: (a) the use of readily accessible electrodes and mild reaction conditions;(b) environmentally friendly conditions for the oxidative cross-coupling of para-substituted phenol C( $sp^{3})-H$ with malononitrile C( $sp^{3})-$ H; (c) the synthesis of malononitrile derivatives with quaternary carbon centers and featuring para-phenol groups; (d) a broad substrate scope.\nTo assess the viability of the C( $sp^{3})-C(sp^{3})$ electrochemical oxidation cross-coupling process, we commenced by examining the reaction between 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (1a) and benzylmalononitrile (2a) under electrochemical conditions (Table 1). The oxidation coupling of 1a and 2a was conducted employing carbon rod electrodes in an undivided cell at a constant current of 3 mA, $with^{n}Bu_{4}NPF_{6}$ serving as the electrolyte. Gratifyingly, utilizing cesium carbonate as the base in a dichloromethane solution at ambient temperature led to the desired product 3a in 65$\\%$ yield (entry 1). Subsequent tests on various bases revealed that triethylamine also exhibited commendable performance (entries 1-5). Further exploration investigated the impact of various solvents on the reaction, with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) demonstrating the highest product yield among dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetone/water, and acetonitrile (entries 1 and 6-9). The impact of different electrodes on reaction yield was studied, highlighting Pt electrodes as superior in generating higher product yields compared to others (entries 9-12). Increasing the amount of cesium carbonate to 2.0 equivalents further improved the yield (entry 13). When less polar and less protic iPrOH is chosen as the solvent for the reaction, the target product can still be obtained in a yield of 72$\\%$ (entry 14). Notably, no conversion of 1a occurred without electric current (entry 15),supporting the validity of the proposed electrolysisdriven reaction mechanism.\nMe\nMe\nCN\nNC'CN\nCN\nOH\nMe\nMe\nMe\n1a\n2a\n3a\nUpon establishing the optimized reaction conditions, our investigation delved into the versatility of the paracresol derivatives, outlined in Scheme 2. This methodology showcases the wide-ranging applicability across various para-cresol derivatives. By incorporating a benzene ring at the ortho position to the hydroxyl group in the para-cresol derivative, we successfully facilitated the efficient formation of the desired products 3b-3f with high yields ranging $\\checkmark$ c\nfrom 90$\\%$ to 97$\\%$. Notably, the validity holds regardless of the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents at the para or meta position of the benzene ring. Furthermore, the method shows efficacy with paracresol derivatives featuring thiophene (3g) and naphthalene ring (3h) substitutions, resulting in the desired products with exceptional yields of 89$\\%$ and 94$\\%$, respectively. Encouragingly, the utilization of the electrochemical oxidation approach also results in the desired products 3i and 3j when tert-butyl substituents are introduced at the ortho position to the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, a satisfactory yield can be attained when an ethyl group substitutes the para position to the hydroxyl group (3k), highlighting the adaptability and capacity of the method to accommodate diverse chemical functionalities. It is worth noting that 2methoxy-4-methylphenol also underwent a smooth reaction with benzylmalononitrile, although the yield was only 25$\\%$(31). However, in the case of substrates like 2,4-dimethylphenol and phenols with one or two bromine atom substituents introduced at the ortho position to the hydroxyl group, the reaction failed to yield the target compounds 3m-3p efficiently.\n$\\frac{Pt((t)|Pt(-),1=3.0 \\space mA}{CS_{2}CO_{3}(2. 0\\text{eq iiv}.)}$\nR OH\nUFliliieedcell\nR1\n2a\n3\nR\nMe\nCN\nMe\nOH\nOH\nMe\nMe\n3a,93$\\%$ yield\n3b,92$\\%$ yield\n3c,R=Cl,94$\\%$ yield 3d,R=OMe,99$\\%$y yield\n/s\nMe\nCN\nCN\nNC'CN\nOH\nOH\nOH\nMe\nMe\nMe\n3e,93$\\%$ yield\n3t,97$\\%$yyield\n3g,89$\\%$ yield\nBu\nBu\nOH\nOH\nOH\nMe\nBu\nMe\n3h,94$\\%$ yield\n3i,89$\\%$ yield\n3j,99$\\%$ yield\nMe\nBu\n-OMe\nMe\n12NCCN\nOH\nCNC CN\nOH\nNC CN\nOH\n3k,97$\\%$ yield\n31,25$\\%$ yield\n3m,trace\nBr\nBr\nBr\nNC'CN\nCN\nOH\nOH\nOH\nMe\nBr\n3n,N.D.\n3o,trace\n3p,ND.\nThe reaction involving malononitrile derivatives 2 was explored using the optimized conditions (Scheme 3). Benzylmalononitrile derivatives with varied substituents on the aryl ring were initially examined. Notably, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, including Me, OMe, Br, and Cl, at the ortho, meta, or para position were well-tolerated, affording products 3q-3x efficiently (7894$\\%$ yield). Moreover, the reaction displayed remarkable reactivity with substrates containing a naphthalene or thiophene ring, producing products 3y and 3z efficiently. Additionally, the method proved successful even with malononitrile derivatives with alkyl substituents (3aa and 3ab).

Previous research has demonstrated that para-cresol derivatives can generate benzyl radical active intermediates under electrochemical oxidation, $^{22a}$ thereby participating in the coupling reaction. In order to determine whether the reaction follows a radical pathway, phenol compound 1q with a cyclopropane group at the para position was synthesized and reacted with benzylmalononitrile (2a) under the standard electrochemical reaction conditions. The results revealed that electrochemical oxidation dehydrogenation coupling product 3ac was obtained in high yield, and the ring-opening product 4 was not observed (Scheme 4a). The electrochemical anodic oxidation of para-cresol derivatives may lead to the crucial intermediate para-quinone methide $\\checkmark$ D\nSyn thesis\nspecies. To test the reaction process, an unstable active intermediate of the para-quinone methide species was produced with the chemical oxidant silver oxide. This intermediate was then reacted with benzylmalononitrile (2a) in the absence of an electric current, producing the desired chemical 3a in 29$\\%$ yield, suggesting that the intermediate paraquinone methide species created by electrochemical oxidation is involved in the reaction process (Scheme 4b).\nFurthermore, when HFIP is utilized as a solvent during the electrochemical reaction, the intermediate para-quinone methide species may selectively form a benzylic HFIP ether intermediate. This intermediate could then participate in a nucleophilic substitution reaction with malononitrile derivatives, leading to the synthesis of the desired target compounds. To test this hypothesis, we initially produced benzylic HFIP ether 6 under electrochemical conditions, which was followed by its reaction with benzylmalononitrile (2a) under nonelectric conditions. Our findings demonstrated the efficient generation of product 3a, confirming the viability of this reaction pathway (Scheme 4c).\nBased on the findings from our mechanistic investigations, we propose a plausible mechanistic pathway for the electrochemical oxidation cross-coupling reaction, outlined in Scheme 4d. Under base conditions, malononitrile derivative 2 forms carbanion intermediate III, which subsequently undergoes nucleophilic addition to the pivotal intermediate para-quinone methide species II generated through the electrochemical anodic oxidation of para-cresol derivative $1.^{25,26}$ This process enables the formation of C( $sp^{3})-$ C( $sp^{3})$ bonds, ultimately leading to the synthesis of the coupling product 3.\nIn conclusion, a novel electrochemical oxidation crosscoupling of para-cresol derivatives and malononitrile derivatives has been established under electrochemical reaction conditions. This method enables the efficient production of a variety of malononitrile derivatives featuring quaternary $\\checkmark$ E\nPaper\ncarbon centers and para-phenol groups, offering a straightforward and eco-friendly pathway for synthesizing a diverse array of malononitrile derivatives.\nUnless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification.

In this transformation, readily accessible N-tosyltriazoles were enabled as stable nitrogen sources for the two scaffolds, and the regioselectivity was controlled by the substituent positions of the hydroxymethylallyl carbonates.\nKey words 2H-pyrrole, 3H-pyrrole, dual catalysis, regioselectivity, Ntosyltriazole\n2H- and 3H-pyrroles are isomers of 1H-pyrroles, which can be found in many natural compounds and possess diverse bioactivities (Figure $1).^{1}$ In contrast to heteroaromatic 1H-pyrroles, 2H- and 3H-pyrroles exhibit unstable nonaromatic properties. Thus, the development of efficient and selective synthetic methods for 2H- and 3H-pyrroles is challenging, and they have typically been used as intermediates for synthesizing 1H-pyrrole derivatives.2 Nevertheless, advances in valuable catalytic reactions for synthesizing Nheterocycles have resulted in the development of some catalytic methods for the synthesis of 2H- and 3H-pyrroles, among which the transition-metal-catalyzed dearomatization of 1H-pyrroles is a representative strategy.3 However, only limited starting materials, such as 2H-azirines, $^{4}$ isooxazolones, $^{5}$ and isoxazoles,6 have been used as nitrogen sources of pyrrole analogues. The construction of 2H- and 3H-pyrroles from readily accessible starting materials containing nitrogen is still challenging, and the development of regioselective strategies for both isomers is highly desirable.\nDual metal catalysis, in which two different catalysts work in relay or synergistically, has emerged as a powerful synthetic strategy, leading to the discovery of novel chemical reactions that cannot be achieved with existing monocatalytic reactions. 7 In particular, dual metal relay catalysis has advantages that allows avoiding the isolation of intermediates and minimizes side reactions due to the rapid transformation of intermediates, resulting in the efficient formation of multiple bonds in one-pot operation. Recently, dual Rh(II)/Pd(0)-catalyzed approaches with high efficiency, regio- and stereoselectivities, and redox compatibility have been developed for the synthesis of various N-heterocycles. Most cases involved the reaction of Pd(II) $- \\pi -$ allyl complexes and a-imino Rh(II)-carbenoids A generated from N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles, in which triazoles were used as stable nitrogen sources. We also disclosed a dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) relay catalysis using N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles 1 and hydroxymethylailyl carbonates 2 to afford N-sulfonylpyrrolidines 3 (Scheme 1A).9 Considering that N-sulfonyl-\nMe\n上\nMe\nMeOH\nOMe\n-OMe\nChamobtusin A\nBuu\n$<_{R^{2}}^{R^{1}}$\nStreptoubin B\nMe\n2Hpyrrole\n3Hpyroll\n$HO_{2}C$\n$CO_{2}MO$\n$\\overset{HO_{2}C}{Me_{1},}$\n- $CO_{2}H$\n$HO_{2}C$\n$CO_{2}M$\nMe...\n...Me\n$HO_{2}C$\nMe\n$CO_{2}H$\nAr=4 $CICC_{S}H_{4}$\n$HO_{2}C$\n$CO_{2}H$\nPrecorin-6B\n$\\checkmark$\nB\nPaper\ntriazoles 1 are reliable and easily accessible nitrogen-containing starting materials, developing a strategy to access valuable 2H- and 3H-pyrrole scaffolds via dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) catalysis from N-sulfonyltriazoles would be highly desirable.\nRecently, we reported a tandem one-pot synthetic method for 2-acyl-substituted NH-pyrroles 4, involving tandem Rh(II)/Pd(0) catalysis using N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles 1 and hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2 and a sequential DBU-promoted E1cB/aromatization (Scheme $1B).^{10}$ In our continuing interest in dual Rh(II)/Pd(0)-catalyzed approaches toward valuable N-heterocycles, we wondered whether it would be possible to access 2H-pyrroles 5 and 3H-pyrroles 6 via a tandem one-pot operation starting from N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles 1 and $R^{2}-$ or $R^{3}-$ disubstituted hydroxymethylallyl carbonates 2a and 2b (Scheme 1C). Considering that 2H- and 3H-pyrroles undergo rapid isomerization into thermodynamically more stable 1H-pyrroles under acidic reaction conditions,11 we anticipated that a dual catalytic approach involving the basic DBU-mediated process would be efficient for regioselective construction of 2H- and 3H-pyrroles. According to previous mechanistic studies, the catalytic reaction would proceed through O-H insertion of hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2 into the catalytically generated a-imino Rh(II)-carbenoid A and [3,3]sigmatropic rearrangement via B to form the common intermediate C [Scheme 1(i)]. Subsequently, the oxidative addition of the Pd catalyst to C would afford zwitterionic Pd(II) $- \\pi -$ allyl complexes D or D'. When using 2a, two cyclization pathways of D are possible: the sterically dominant path a and the electronically favored path b. By optimizing the reaction conditions, 2H-pyrrole 5 could be selectively formed via path b, followed by DBU-promoted processes via E. In the case of 2b, 3H-pyrrole 6 would be formed via intramolecular cyclization of D' and a DBU-promoted E1cB/double-bond isomerization process. Herein, we report tandem one-pot synthetic methods for 2H-pyrroles 5 and 3H-pyrroles 6 controlled by the substituent positions of hydroxymethylallyl carbonates 2.\nOur previous studies have shown that the DBU-promoted E1cB elimination of prepared dimethyl-substituted N-tosylpyrrolidines and a double-bond isomerization cascade occur regioselectively, affording 2H- and 3H-pyrroles.10 Based on previous work, tandem one-pot approaches involving dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) catalysis were attempted in this study using Rh2(OPiv)4,Pd(dba)2,bisphosphine ligand,and excess DBU in toluene, starting from N-tosyl-1,2,3-triazole 1a and dimethyl hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2a or 2b. When using 2a with Rh2(OPiv)4,Pd(dba)2,and BINAP ligand L1, 2H-pyrrole 5a was isolated in 9$\\%$ yield in a one-pot multistep operation (Table 1,entry 1). Notably, the formation of a regioisomer such as F [in Scheme 1(i)] was not observed, indicating that the intramolecular cyclization of zwitterionic Pd(II) $- \\pi -$ allyl complex D is driven by electronic factors. In the same catalytic system, the use of 1.2 equivalents of 1a slightly increased the efficiency of this tandem process, affording 5a in 22$\\%$ yield (entry 2). On the other hand, when the Xantphos ligand L2 was used instead of L1, the desired product 5a was not detected (entry 3). To improve the reaction efficiency for the synthesis of 2H-pyrrole 5a, tandem Rh(II)/Pd(0) catalysis and a sequential DBU process were then tested according to our previous research. Interestingly, when applying concurrent tandem catalysis (CTC) conditions (conditions B) using the same catalyst system as in entry 2, Table 1, product 5a was not detected (entry 4). Employing ligand L2 instead of ligand L1, 2H-pyrrole 5a was isolated in 46$\\%$ yield (entry 5). And, reducing the amount of $Rh_{2}$ (OPiv $)_{4}(0.5$ mol$\\%$) and 1a compound (1.0 equiv.) led to a reaction proceeding with a yield of 20$\\%$ for compound 5a, similar to dual catalysis (entry 6). It is noteworthy that conditions B involving the CTC process not only increased the efficiency but also reduced the amount of Rh(II) catalyst and the reaction time. Although the one-pot approach for 5a involving dual catalysis (conditions A) results in a relatively low product yield and long reaction time, it has the advantage of easy handling. Therefore, it can be used as a $\\checkmark$ c\nPaper\ncomplement to the CTC approach (conditions B). With the two optimal reaction conditions in hand, the feasibility of the tandem one-pot synthesis of 3H-pyrrole 6a was examined using 1a and 2b, finding that product 6a was efficiently obtained in 47$\\%$ and 69$\\%$ yields under the optimal reaction conditions A and B, respectively (entries 7 and 8). Then, we conducted control experiments using a Rh(II) or Pd(0)mono-catalytic system (Scheme 2). When using a Rh2(OPiv)4 catalyst, the reaction of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazole 1a with dimethyl hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2a or 2b did not yield the desired pyrrole product, and the amine product 7a or 7b was obtained, confirming the reaction intermediate of Rh(II) catalysis [Scheme 1(i), C]. On the other hand, neither intermediate C nor 2H-pyrrole 5a was detected in mono-catalytic Pd(0) catalysis, indicating that Rh(II) catalysis is prior to Pd(0) catalysis in this dual metal relay catalysis (Scheme 2B).\nHO、\nOBcc\n2a\n$\\overset{DBU}{\\text{excess}})$\nconditions A\\\\R $h_{2}$ (OPiv))/Pd(dba) $_{2}$\n5a\nLigand toluene, $100 ^\\circ\\text{C} C$\nMe Me\n1) $Rh_{2}$ (OPiv) $_{4}$\nHO\n$\\overset{OBOC}{\\xrightarrow{2b}}$ (excess)\nMe.\nMe\n$Me \\rightarrow Me$\n$PPh_{2}$\nPPh22\npphh\n11\n2\nNext, the reaction scope for the synthesis of 2H-pyrroles 5 was investigated using N-tosyl-1,2,3-triazoles 1 and hydroxymethylallyl carbonates 2 (Table 2). As mentioned above, complementary tandem processes involving two different catalytic systems, dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) catalysis (conditions A) and CTC (conditions B), were examined. Under optimal conditions A, the reactions of 2a with N-tosyltriazoles 1b and 1c, featuring a 3-methyl- and 4-n-hexyl-substituted phenyl ring at the $R^{1}$ positions, respectively, afforded low yields of 22$\\%$ and 31$\\%$ for products 5b and 5c, respectively(Table 2, entries 2 and 3). After exploring the reaction efficiency under reaction conditions A, the reaction scope was also investigated in CTC process using various N-tosyltriazoles. Under the optimal reaction conditions B, the reactions of 2a with N-tosyltriazoles 1b and 1c bearing a 3methyl- and 4-n-hexyl-substituted phenyl group at $R^{1}$ positions, respectively, smoothly proceeded to provide the corresponding products 5b and 5c in increased yields of 51$\\%$and 63$\\%$ (entries 2 and 3). After confirming that the dual Rh(II)/Pd(0)-catalyzed CTC process showed better reaction efficiency, the substrate scope was screened under optimal reaction conditions B. Triazoles 1d-f bearing methoxide and electron-withdrawing groups, F and $CF_{3},$ at the parapositions of the phenyl ring afforded the corresponding products 5d-f regioselectively, albeit in low to moderate yields (entries 4-6). When $R^{1}$ was a naphthyl group, the desired product 5g was obtained in 43$\\%$ yield (entry 7). It is noteworthy that the desired products 5b-g could also be selectively synthesized via one-pot processes of dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) catalysis. In general, the product yields were lower, but the reaction efficiency according to the electronic properties was similar to that observed reactivities under conditions B.\nUnder reaction conditions B, which afforded better reaction efficiency, the tandem one-pot synthesis of 3H-pyrroles 6 was attempted. Various N-tosyl-1,2,3-triazoles 1 bearing electron-donating groups, Me, n-Hex, and OMe,\n$\\checkmark$ D\nSyn thesis\ncondlions A\\\\ Ph(ll),Pd(0),L1\nMe Me\n$\\frac{DBU \\\\(3 \\space equiv)}{100 ^\\circ\\text{C}}$\n1) Rh(i))\n<Me\n2a\nMe\nand halogen groups, F and $CF_{3},$ at different positions (orthoand para-) on the phenyl rings at $R^{1}$ were well tolerated in these transformations and provided the corresponding products 6b-f in moderate to good yields ranging from 36$\\%$to 70$\\%$ (Table 3). When $R^{1}$ was a naphthyl group, the desired product 6g was efficiently synthesized in a good yield of 69$\\%$ in multiple steps. The synthesis of 3H-pyrroles was attempted using various hydroxymethylallyl carbonates 2. Usymmetrical substituents (Ph and Me groups) containing hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2c was tolerated in this transformation to afford the corresponding product 6h, albeit in low yield. The reaction of 1a and 2-cyclopentylidenyl hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2d was then tested, but the desired product 6i was not detected. We found that dual metal catalysis was enabled to give N-tosylpyrrolidine 8a, but the E1cB reaction by DBU did not occur. Similarly, 3Hpyrrole 6j bearing SMe groups was not synthesized, and only intermediate 8b was isolated, confirming that the steric and electronic properties of the substituents significantly affect the DBU-mediated E1cB process. When using diphenyl-substituted hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2f, the desired product 6k was not detected, and only intermediate 7c formed from Rh(II) catalysis was obtained (see the Supporting Information).\nIn summary, we have developed dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) relay catalysis and sequential DBU-mediated processes for the one-pot regioselective synthesis of 2H- and 3H-pyrroles using N-tosyltriazoles and hydroxymethylallyl carbonates. Readily accessible N-tosyltriazoles were used as nitrogen sources to obtain valuable 2H- and 3H-pyrroles via multiple bond formation/cleavage steps.

The reaction flasks were flame-dried, and solvents were transferred using an oven-dried syringe. Toluene was distilled over sodium. The heating source of all transition metal catalytic reactions was from heating mantle. Commercially available chemical reagents and other anhydrous solvents from Aldrich Chemical Co., Acros Organics, Alfa Aesar, and TCI were directly used without further purification. TLC was performed on silica gel 60 $GF_{254}$ aluminum plates (Merck). TLC plates were visualized using a short-wave UV light (254 and 365 nm) or a $KMnO_{4}$ solution. Flash chromatography was performed on Merck silica gel (60-200 mesh) using standard techniques. $^{1}H and^{13}C$ NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX-300 and Bruker DRX-400 spectrometers, and the chemical shifts $(\\delta)in^{I}H$ NMR spectra are given in ppm relative to TMS ( $CDCl_{3}: \\delta _{H}=7.26, \\delta _{c}=77.16).$ The HRMS data (highresolution mass spectra) were obtained by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-QTOF) from SYNAPT G2 (Waters, U.K.) and measured by fast atom bombardment(FAB) mode using a JEOL(JMS700). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) of compounds 7a, 7b and 6h were obtained from the KBSI (Korea Basic Science Institute Daegu Center).\n$\\checkmark$ E\nPaper\nSynthesis of 7; General Procedure\nTo a flame-dried reaction tube equipped with a stirring bar, triazole 1a (0.12 mmol, 1.2 equiv), 2-hydroxymethylallyl carbonate 2 (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), $Rh_{2}$ (OPiv $)_{4}(1.2$ mg,2 mol$\\%$), 4 A MS (20 mg), and toluene (2.0 mL) were added under an argon atmosphere.

Here, we present the successful development of stereodivergent allylic C( $sp^{3})-H$ bond arylations through a systematic investigation of the direction and degree of stereoselectivity in the crosscoupling process. In contrast to the signature photosensitized geometrical isomerization of alkenes, the catalytic reaction demonstrates the feasibility of switching the C-C double bond stereoselectivity by means of ligand control as well as steric and electronic effects. Computational studies explain the stereochemical outcome and indicate that excitation of a Ni-allyl complex from singlet to a triplet state results in a spontaneous change of the allyl group coordination and that the subsequent isomerization can be directed by the choice of the ligand to achieve E/Z selectivity.\nAlkenes occur widely in nature and are feedstocks in various fields of the chemical industry, ranging from the vast scale manufacture of plastics and detergents to the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates and $fragrances^{1}.$ The selective construction of C-C double bonds in alkenes, either the E or the higher energetic Zisomer, has long been one of the fundamental yet elusive topics in the advancement of organic chemistry. In this regard, classical carbonyl olefination, elimination reaction and alkyne addition reaction are commonly used, albeit with the loss of valuable $functionalities^{2}.$ On the other hand, the ideal and most straightforward way is the direct functionalization of pre-existing alkenes. In the past decades, a variety of catalytic methodologies, including olefin metathesis, Heck-type cross-coupling and alkene isomerization have emerged as attractive approaches for the convergent synthesis of stereo-defined $alkenes^{3,4}.$ Of these approaches, methods based on transition-metal catalyzed alkene positional and geometrical isomerization were developed to selectively access isomers through an energetically net \"downhill\" $process^{5},$ whereas photochemical geometrical isomerization has offered a route in the opposite direction but with the limitation only being suitable for chromophoric $substrates^{6-9}.$ Despite these advances, there are no corresponding transformations that are broadly applicable to the siteselective and stereodivergent preparation of multi-substituted alkenes under mild conditions. The quest for novel and selective methodologies remains a subject of intensive study.\nIn recent years, visible-light photocatalysis enabled C-H bond functionalization has received widespread $attention^{10-15}.$ One of the most recent prominent advances is photoredox nickel dual catalysis enabled C-H bond cross-coupling. Within this subdomain of metallaphotoredox $catalysis^{16,17},$ two fundamentally distinct pathways have been utilized for the generation of reactive open-shell $species^{18}$ from native C-H functionality: (1) direct oxidative single-electron transfer(SET) between substrates and excited state of $photocatalyst^{19,20}$ and (2) hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) of native $sp^{3}\\space C-H$ bonds by appropriate photo-generated N, O, S, X(Cl, Br) radicals or photoexcited polyoxometalate $species^{21-31}.$ As a result, a very diverse class of substrates such as ethers, amides, alcohols, aldehydes, alkenes, and alkanes, have been successfully employed in the coupling with aryl or alkyl halides to create valuable C( $sp^{2})-C(sp^{3})$ or C( $sp^{3})-C(sp^{3})bonds^{32,33}.$ Although significant effort has been dedicated to controlling site-selectivity among these developments, very few examples are associated with the controlling of $stereochemistry^{34-36}.$ Specifically, methods concerning the stereoselective preparation of multi-substituted alkenes in either E or Z isomeric forms are still not known. Our continuous interest in photoredox-enabled allylic C-H bond functionalization prompted us\na) Challenges\nond functionalization in photoreodx nickel dual catalysi\nto develop a general method that can selectively give the alkenes in either E or Z $configuration^{37,38}.$\nHerein, we demonstrate a highly stereoselective allylic C( $sp^{3})-H$ bond cross-coupling of alkenes through the synergistic combination of photoredox and nickel catalysis (Fig. $1)^{39}.$\nResults\nRational design and optimization\nWe initially tried to identify suitable reaction conditions that are effective for allylic C( $sp^{3})-H$ cross-couplings of silyl enol ethers. We also like to highlight an important recent study by Studer and co-workers, who accomplished an efficient C( $sp^{3})-H$ functionalization of enol $ethers^{40}.$ The investigation began with the coupling of silyl enol ether 1 and methyl 4-bromobenzoate (2). After considerable efforts, we were delighted to see that with readily available reagents, including photocatalyst Ir[dF( $CF_{3})$ ppy $]_{2}$ (dtbbpy) $PF_{6}(1$ mol$\\%$), $NiCl_{2}\\cdot$ DME(10mol$\\%$), 4,4'-di-tert-butylbipyridine(dtbbpy)(15mol$\\%$)and2,6-lutidine(1.5 equiv.) we were able to obtain the desired product in excellent yield (83$\\%$) with good E selectivity (88$\\%$). The reactions were carried out using blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at room temperature(Table 1). Control experiments showed that no detectable product was formed in the absence of light irradiation, ligand, base, nickel catalyst, or photocatalyst, showcasing the essential role of all components in this synergistic catalysis. Seeking to improve on the stereoselectivity, we next evaluated several classes of ligands and found that dtbbpy was the best choice of ligand for E selectivity. In the meantime, we were excited to find that a moderate Z selectivity (74$\\%$) was realized when 6,6'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (6,6'-dmbpy) was employed, albeit with low conversion. This observation of ligand effects prompted us to further examine the reaction conditions. After extensive evaluation of different reaction parameters (see Supporting Information), we successfully established two sets of reaction conditions allowing for a stereoselectivity switch: the use of dtbbpy (L1) led to E isomer 3 (93$\\%$) in 77$\\%$ yield (condition A) and employing 6,6'-dmbpy (L2) gave Z isomer 4 in 66$\\%$ yield (condition B) after isolation. To the best of our\nTable 1 | Optimization of the reaction $conditions^{a}$\nPC-1(1mol$\\%$)\\\\ Naat,L$\\%$)\\\\base, solvent\nOTBS\nOTBS\nOTBS\n$MeO_{2}C$\n$CO_{2}Me$\n1,3 equiv.\n2.1 equiv.\n$CO_{2}Me$\n$PF_{6}^{-}$\nCF\ndtbbpy\n6,6-dmbpy\nPC-1\n2\nArticle\nknowledge, the use of ligands to tune E/Z stereoselectivity in photoredox nickel dual catalysis has never been reported.\nSynthetic scope\nWith these reaction conditions in hand, we first turned our attention to evaluating the electrophilic coupling partners for the scope of E isomer with condition A. As shown in Fig. 2, a wide range of electron-deficient functional groups (ketone, ester, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, sulfone, chloro, sulfonamide) at the para position on the aryl bromides were well-tolerated using this synergistic strategy and providing the corresponding products 3-11 in good yields (58-83$\\%$) and excellent E selectivities (89$\\%$ to only E isomer). In addition, comparable good results could be obtained for both electron-neutral and electron-rich bromoarenes in contrast to their intrinsic difficulty in oxidative addition (12-17,58-66$\\%$ yield,95$\\%$ to only E isomer). Moreover, the installation of meta-monosubstituted or disubstituted functional groups on the aryl halide turned out to be successful (18-21,55-71$\\%$yield), excellent levels of stereocontrol were archived regardless of their electronic nature (97$\\%$ to only E isomer). However, it is note worthy that the reaction failed with substrates bearing ortho substituents under current reaction conditions. Nearly quantitatively hydro-dehalogenated products were obtained instead. This can be attributed to steric bulkiness. Polycyclic bromoarenes derived from naphthalene, phthalide, and phthalimide performed very well in the reaction (22-24, 61-73$\\%$ yield, 93$\\%$ to only E isomer). Additionally, pharmaceutically important heteroaryl bromides bearing indole, azaindole, quinoline, and pyridine moieties proved to be competent coupling partners with this reaction manifold(25-28,51-71$\\%$ yield, 88-96$\\%$ E isomer).\nHaving demonstrated the generality of this protocol for relatively simple substrates, we next set out to examine the synthetic potential for the late-stage cross-coupling of structurally diverse bioactive compounds. Aryl bromide electrophiles from indomethacin, sulfadimethoxine, celecoxib, diacetone-D-galactose, and pregnenolone were smoothly converted into their corresponding silyl enol ether (29-33, 52-72$\\%$ yield, 93$\\%$ to only E isomer). These results further highlight the robust functional group tolerance of the current development. Notably, only a trace amount of THF arylation adduct resulting from competitive solvent C( $sp^{3})\\cdot H$ coupling was observed.\nWe next surveyed the scope of alkenes (Fig. 3) by increasing the steric bulkiness of the silyl group from TBS to TIPS, leading to comparable yield with higher level of E selectivity (34,73$\\%$ yield, 96$\\%$ E isomer). High levels of stereoselectivity (93$\\%$ to only E isomer) and good isolated yields (57-71$\\%$) were observed for a variety of enol ethers, as demonstrated by either cyclopentyl (35), phenyl (36), ethyl (38), benzyl (40) substituted or bulky ones from (-)-borneol (37) and (-)-menthol (39). If the size of the additional substituent in the $\\alpha -$ position of silyl enol ether is increased, the stereoselectivity decreases, with lower E selectivity obtained for 41 (76$\\%$) and 42 (77$\\%$). The steric influence is high, and Z selectivity was achieved with substrates carrying tert-butyl and 2-methylphenyl substituents providing the corresponding products in good to excellent Z/E ratio (43-45, 84-98$\\%$). Similarly, excellent selectivity was observed in the case of steric-demanding alkene (46). Importantly, further investigation revealed that this method is not restricted to acyclic alkenes. Cyclic substrates have also been efficiently functionalized (47 and 48), showcasing the broad applicability of the current protocol. The cross-coupling can be further extended to styrenes, followed by a visible-lightinduced Z to E isomerization. The corresponding styrene products were obtained in moderate yields and excellent E selectivity(49 and 50).\nWe subsequently pursued to examine the generality of condition B that could promote Z selective arylation of the allylic C( $sp^{3})-H$ bonds. As outlined in Fig. 4, a broad range of electronrich and electron-poor aryl bromides served as effective coupling partners. In all cases, the arylation reactions proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity under the standard conditions(4,51-57,91$\\%$ to only Z isomer). To achieve good efficiency for electron-rich substrates, the use of LiBr as an external bromine additive is crucial (58 to 61, 40-57$\\%$ yield, only Z isomer). In contrast, only moderate Z selectivity can be obtained for heterocycle derived from pyridine (63,74$\\%$ Z). The superior reactivity of C2-substituted bidentate ligand in alkene $isomerization^{41-44}$ prompted us to question whether the current protocol could be used to initiate the double bond positional isomerization, allowing for the subsequent regio- and stereoselective arylation reaction at the terminal position of the allylic system. With our optimized condition B, we were pleased to find that the synergistic catalytic mode allows the allylic silyl ether to smoothly participate in the desired isomerization/cross-coupling sequence while achieving high levels of stereocontrol (52,61$\\%$yield, only Z). Furthermore, a commercially available allyl benzene derivative could also be employed, generating the corresponding arylation adduct 64 with a high degree of Z selectivity(only Z). The scope was further extended to an N-allyl-carbazole derivative, affording the desired product 65. Lastly, the synthetic potential of this method was showcased in the stereospecific Simmon-Smith cyclopropanation of silyl enol ether (see Supporting Information).\nMechanistic investigations\nTo investigate a plausible mechanism for the stereodivergent crosscoupling, we initially looked for direct evidence of allylic radical formation by introducing a well-known carbon radical scavenger TEMPO(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy). The reaction efficiency diminished dramatically in the presence of the radical inhibitor; the yield dropped to only 19$\\%$ when 2 equiv. TEMPO was used. The TEMPO adduct 67 was observed $by^{1}H$ NMR of the crude reaction mixture and further confirmed by HRMS analysis. We next sought to understand the elementary steps that are closely associated with the allylic radical generation. Although (silyl) enol ethers are known to be electron-rich alkenes, cyclic voltammetry studies showed that the direct SET oxidation by the photoexcited PC $-1 \\space(^{*}E_{1/2}=1.21$ Vvs. SCE in MeCN) should be difficult. The steady-state Stern-Volmer quenching study also revealed that the silyl enol ether does not quench the excited state of Ir photocatalyst (see Supporting Information). These findings preclude the generation of allylic radicals by the SET event. Moreover, aryl iodide 68 failed to be a competent coupling partner because of the weak hydrogen abstraction ability (Fig. 5b, H-I BDE = 71 kcal/mol) $^{45}.$ We therefore hypothesized a HAT process by bromine radical might be operative. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that several representative olefins with very high oxidation potentials, cyclopentene (47), cyclohexene (48) and enol acetate (70) were suitable candidates for the cross-coupling.\nEmploying an E/Z mixture of silyl enol ether 71 gave similar results as in the case of the Z isomer only, indicating the geometry loss of the double bond during the course of the reaction. Interestingly, we found that the Z-configured starting material in the latter case was converted into an E/Z mixture following a careful inspection of the reaction crude mixture. In a control experiment without nickel catalyst under the standard condition, the Z isomer remained to a high degree (92$\\%$) intact (Fig. 6a). These experiments suggest the possibility that the nickel-allyl species was involved in the reaction. We then carried out the stoichiometric experiment of aryl-Ni(II) complex 73 (derived from 4-methylchlorobenzene and dtbbpy) with 1, no product of 13 was found (Fig. 6b). In comparison, the stoichiometric reaction of in-situ generated allylnickel(II) complex 74 produced the corresponding silyl enol ether product in moderate yields. More importantly, the stereoselectivity for product formation by choice of the ligand is consistent\n3\nArticle\n(1 mol$\\%$), $NiBr_{2}(10$ mol$\\%$), dtbbpy (15 mol$\\%$), benzene/THF 1:1 (2 mL), rt,48-72 h, yields and E/Z after purification by chromatography (numbers in parentheses refer to E/Z before purification).

We also observed that the ratio of ligand to nickel could affect the stereoselectivity with dtbbpy ligand, and the nickel-allyl isomerization mechanism can be excluded given that the same E selectivity was obtained when the stoichiometric experiment was performed in the presence of Zn as reductant without light irradiation (see Supporting Information). Based on our mechanistic studies, a plausible mechanism is proposed (Fig. 6d). Upon irradiation with visible light, the Ir photocatalyst generates a long-lived triplet excited state, which should be able to oxidize the bromide anion to the active bromine radical. Subsequent hydrogen atom abstraction from the allylic position of alkene 1 yields the carbon-centered radical 1'. In line with previous reports, this allyl radical is readily trapped by the doublet Ni(I)Br (A) to produce the Ni(II)(allyl)Br intermediate B. Single-electron reduction of B by the reduced state of the photocatalyst leads to the Ni(I)(allyl) complex C, which undergoes oxidative addition of the aryl bromide to produce the corresponding Ni(III)(allyl)(aryl)Br complex D. The catalytic cycle ends with the facile reductive elimination of the desired cross-coupling product and concurrent regeneration of the active catalyst A.\nIn support of the above control experiments and our proposed reaction mechanism, we performed DFT calculations (see Computational Details in Supporting Information) to define the catalytic mechanism. Possible pathways of photocatalytic cycles are discussed in Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16. Our results show that the oxidative photoredox cycle is favored during the formation of active Ni-complex from the pre-catalyst $NiBr_{2}.$ On the other hand, the reductive cycle is favored in the case of the Ni-catalytic pathway.\nWe have investigated the Ni-catalytic cycle starting from LNi'-Br as the active $catalyst^{16,47}.$ The free-energy profile of the complete nickel catalytic pathway for the E-product (3) formation in the presence of dtbbpy ligand is shown in Fig. 7a, while the Z-product (4) pathway is shown in the Supplementary Fig. 17. In addition, both E- and Z-product formation pathways with 6,6'-dmbpy ligand are depicted in the Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19. The Ni-catalytic cycle starts with the radical addition $R_{E}$ to the nickel atom $of^{2}A1$ (Fig. 7a). The $resulting^{1}A2_{E}$ undergoes endergonic $le^{-}$ reduction $by^{2}$ Irill to $generate^{2}A3_{E}$ and $Br^{-}$ (SET1, Fig. 7a). Further le- oxidation of Br- coupled $with^{3}Ir^{III}/^{2}$ reduction (SET2) leads to Br., which is involved in the HAT step to generate allyl radical from 1. The reaction continues with the oxidative addition of 2 to $the^{2}A3_{E}$ via transition $state^{2}[A3_{E}-A4_{E}]^{\\ddagger}$ and the energy barrier of 25.3 kcal/mol, leading $to^{2}A4_{E}.$ The Ni-cycle is completed by facile reductive elimination of the product $from^{2}A4_{E}$ via transition $state^{2}[A4_{E}-A1]^{\\dagger}$ and an activation barrier of 5.4 kcal/mol, regenerating active $catalyst^{2}A1$ with the liberation of the E-product 3. Consistently with the experiments (Fig. 6c), calculations suggest that E-Z isomerization of the allyl moiety is possible at the LNi(III)(allyl)Br complex, $^{1}A2_{E}$ in Fig. 7a. Therefore, the E-/Z- product selectivity is occurring at this intermediate, depending on the relative feasibility between isomerization step and the corresponding SET.\nThe allyl isomerization is expected to occur via a classic $\\eta ^{3}\\rightarrow \\eta ^{1}\\rightarrow \\eta ^{3}$ mechanism involving C-C bond rotation after the formation of the $\\eta ^{1}$ Ni-C-C=C species and dissociation of the localized C=C bond from Ni. However, in the singlet state this isomerization is highly disfavored $for^{1}A2_{E}and^{l}B2_{E},$ with free-energy barriers of 48.4 and 50.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 21, 22).

The $\\eta ^{1}-$ isomers $of^{3}A2_{E}$ $and^{3}B2_{E}$ undergo C-C bond rotation to generate the respective Z- $isomer^{3}A2_{z}and^{3}B2z$ at the triplet state (Fig. 7b). In the case of the dtbbpy ligand, the most stable $\\eta ^{i}$ isomer has the unsubstituted carbon of the allyl group o-bonded to the Ni atom, which requires Z-isomerization occurring through rotation around the partial C-C(OTBS) double bond, with an energy barrier $(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}=20.2$ kcal/mol) higher than that of the le- reduction step, $(\\Delta G_{MH}^{\\ddagger}=8.6$ kcal/mol, SET1 in Fig. 7a). This indicates that formation of the Z-product is unfeasible. Differently, in the case of the 6,6'-dmbpy ligand, the most stable $\\eta ^{1}$ isomer has a well-defined Ni-C(OTBS) o-bond. Consequently, E/Z isomerization occurs via rotation around a C-C single bond with a low\n6\nfree-energy barrier $(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}=10.8$ kcal/mol), and the corresponding Zisomer $(^{3}B2z)$ is favored energetically. This suggests a higher population of the Z-isomer over the E one prior to the le- reduction step $(\\Delta G_{MH}^{\\dagger}=20.5$ kcal/mol, SET4 in Supplementary Fig. 18). Alternative mechanisms were explored for the E/Z isomerization with dtbbpy ligand. However, those are unfavored due to very high energy pathways (see Supplementary Fig. 19).\nComparison of $the^{3}A2_{E}and^{3}B2_{E}$ geometries explains the different impact of the two ligands on the isomerization step (Fig. 7b). The reduced steric hindrance $in^{3}A2_{E}$ allows partial $\\pi$ coordination to nickel of the formally $n^{1}$ allyl group, with a relatively short C-C(OTBS) bond $(1.379 \\space \\dot{A}),$ allowing rotation with the high energy barrier of Fig. 7b. Differently, due to steric substitutes at 6,6' position $in^{3}B2_{E},$ only one C atom of the $\\eta ^{1}$ allyl is interacting with nickel, allowing for low energy rotation (see Fig. 7b) around a C-C bond having a strong single bond character (1.477 A, Fig. 8).\nAlthough the cross-coupling of substrates bearing geminal dimethyl moiety has occurred with high levels of regio- and stereocontrol, we observed a small amount of product (2$\\%$) from diarylation. With this in mind, we next examined the feasibility of the direct use of a monoarylated product as the coupling partner. To our delight, the sequential diarylation is successfully applied with both electron-rich and electron-deficient aryl bromides to prepare diarylated silyl enol ethers (Fig. 9). Interestingly, our standard reaction conditions can achieve stereocontrol by discriminating substituent electronics. For instance, if the aryl ring of the substrate has an electron-donating substituent, introducing another one bearing an electron-withdrawing para substituent could give 76 in 51$\\%$ yield and 85$\\%$ E selectivity using L1. By switching to conditions with L2, the inverse configuration of the double bond can be obtained (77,57$\\%$ yield and 82$\\%$ Z selectivity). This shows the potential for stereoselective alkene synthesis by exploiting the electronic property of the substrates.\nIn conclusion, we have developed a general method that permits the regio- and stereoselective synthesis of alkenes. This protocol enables catalytic allylic radical generation directly from simple and readily available alkenes and accommodates a wide variety of aryl halide coupling partners. Different from previous mechanistic proposals on C( $sp^{3})-H$ functionalization with photoredox nickel dual catalysis, our experimental evidence, and detailed computational mechanistic studies support a Ni(I)-allyINi(II)-allyINi(I)-Ni(III) catalytic cycle. Computational studies further explain the stereochemical outcome and indicate that excitation of a Ni(II)-allyl complex from singlet to a triplet state results in a spontaneous change of the allyl group coordination and that the subsequent ligand-dependent isomerization can be directed by choice of the ligand to achieve E/Z selectivity. These unexpected findings led us systematically investigate the stereoselectivity and to develop stereodivergent allylic C( $sp^{3})\\cdot H$ bond arylations in which a ligand switch allows the target synthesis of E and Z isomers of silyl enol ethers.\nMethods\nGeneral procedure E for the cross-coupling reaction towards E selectivity (condition A)\nTo a 15 mL vial equipped with a stir bar was added NiBr2 (4.4 mg,20 $\\mu$ mol, 0.1 equiv.) and 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (8.1 mg, $30 \\space \\mu$ mol, 0.15 equiv), Ir[dF( $CF_{3})$ ppy $]_{2}$ (dtbbpy) $PF_{6}(2.3$ mg,0.002mmol,1mol$\\%$), aryl halide (0.2mmol,1 equiv.),2,6-lutidine(32.1mg $(\\sim 35 \\mu L)$ , 0.3mmol,1.5 equiv.) and alkene (0.6mmol,3 equiv.).A mixture of benzene (1 mL) and THF (1 mL) was added, then the vial was degassed and under stirring irradiated with the corresponding blue LEDs photoreactor.\nGeneral procedure F for the cross-coupling reaction towards Z selectivity (condition B)\nTo a 15 mL vial equipped with a stir bar was added $NiBr_{2}(8.8$ mg, $40 \\space \\mu$ mol, 0.2 equiv.) and 6,6'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (7.4 mg, 0.04mmol,20mol$\\%$),Ir[dF( $CF_{3})$ ppy $]_{2}$ (dtbbpy) $PF_{6}(2.3$ mg, 0.002mmol,1mol$\\%$),aryl halide (0.2mmol,1 equiv.),2,4,6-collidine(72.7mg $(\\sim 80 \\mu L),0.6$ mmol,3.0equiv.)andalkene(0.6mmol,3 equiv.).A mixture of dioxane (1mL) and THF (1mL) was added, then the vial was degassed and under stirring irradiated with the corresponding blue LEDs photoreactor.\nArticle\nFig. 7 | DFT calculated reaction energy profile. a Free-energy profile of Nicatalytic cycle in the presence of dtbbpy ligand for E-product (3) formation.

However, direct cross-coupling with readily accessible alkenyl acetates via inert C-O bond-cleavage for the carbonheteroatom bond construction remains challenging. Here we report a practical preparation of stereoselective tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenyl silanes and stannanes by performing cobalt-catalyzed C-O silylation and stannylation of alkenyl acetates using silylzinc pivalate and stannylzinc chloride as the nucleophiles. This protocol features a complete control of chemoselectivity, stereoselectivity, as well as excellent functional group compatibility. The resulting alkenyl silanes and stannanes show high reactivities in arylation and alkenylation by Hiyama and Stille reactions. The synthetic utility is further illustrated by the facile late-stage modifications of natural products and druglike molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction might involve a chelation-assisted oxidative insertion of cobalt species to C-O bond. We anticipate that our findings should prove instrumental for potential applications of this technology to organic syntheses and drug discoveries in medicinal chemistry.\nTransition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have been recognized as a powerful toolbox for the construction of C-C and C-X(X = heteroatoms) bonds, which play a vital role in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and feedstock commodity $chemicals^{1-5}.$ For practical applications and easy availability in synthesis, oxygen-based electrophiles have been recognized as halide-free alternatives for coupling with organometallic $reagents^{6-10}.$ Among them, alkenyl esters represent an attractive candidate for nonaromatic functionality due to their versatile occurrence in biomassderived chemicals and convenient preparation. However, most of the advances in cross-couplings were accomplished with activated esters, such as triflate, tosylate, sulfamate, carbamate, phosphate, and carbonate. Hence, numerous contributions have been made to further expand the library of $electrophiles^{11-16}.$ Alkenyl $acetates^{17-19},$ as a class of(pseudo)halide electrophile bearing a small and nonhazardous leaving group, have received considerable recent $attention^{20}.$ While unactivated enol acetates in coupling reactions remain a significant challenge due to the selective cleavage issue between vinyl $Csp^{2}-O$ and acetyl-O bonds (445 vs 335 kJ/mol) $^{21}.$ As such, using mild nucleophilic reagents as the coupling partners or/and devising highly active catalytic systems, which operate under kinetic control rather than a thermodynamic pathway, are the key for achieving cross-couplings via selective vinyl $Csp^{2}-0$ bond cleavage (Fig. 1a).\nSince Shi22 and Garg23 independently pioneered the feasibility of nickel-catalyzed Negishi- and Suzuki-coupling reactions by using alkenyl pivalates as the electrophiles, alkenyl acetates have been extensively exploited for transition metal-catalyzed C-C bond formation cross-coupling reactions with B, Zn, Mg-based organometallics\nusing $Ni^{24}, \\space Fe^{21},$ and Pd $catalysis^{28-30}.$ Moreover, $Ackermann^{31}$ disclosed the chelation-assisted cobalt-catalyzed $Csp^{2}-H$ alkenylations of indoles with alkenyl acetates, which underwent a remarkably mild C-O bond cleavage as compared to the ruthenium $catalysis^{32}. Gosmini^{33-35}$ and $Shu^{36}$ also reported the applications of vinyl acetates in Co- and Ni-catalyzed reductive arylation and alkylation. Despite these major advances, major challenges in the area of C-O functionalization with alkenyl acetates still need to be overcome:(i) in contrast to the common alkenyl C-C bond formation, rather rare examples of alkenyl C-heteroatom bond formation were developed; 37(ii) most of the progresses have been made with cyclic, non- or mono substituted alkenyl acetates as the coupling partners, rather poor Z/Eselectivity is observed when employing acyclic tri- or tetrasubstituted alkenyl acetates as the coupling partners. Hence, the methods aimed at C-heteroatom bond formation and stereo-controllable C-O cross coupling are highly desirable (Fig. 1b).\nTowards the mechanism of C-O bond activation, two plausible pathways have been given: initial transmetalation between organometallics and transition metal catalyst forms the C-[TM] species, which undergoes (i) oxidative insertion of C-O bond to the [TM]center, along with following reductive elimination; or (ii) 1,2-carbometalation of enol carboxylates, in tandem with isomerization (II and III) and trans-, or syn-elimination. Therefore, avoiding the latter pathway, selective oxidative insertion to form a single diastereomer intermediate (I) is the key for achieving stereoselective C-O functionalization (Fig. $1c)^{20}.$ We hypothesized that the challenging issue would be solved by introducing a removable directing group into the polysubstituted alkenyl acetates, thereby preferentially realizing chelationassisted oxidative insertion of transition metal species to C-O bond, rather than 1,2-nucleophilic addition process. In this context, acyclic tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenyl acetates bearing a modulable carbonyl group are attractive alternative candidates: OAc imparts better mass efficiency than other leaving groups, carbonyl groups are valuable functional groups and versatile precursors for alcohols, amines, and other important functionalities in organic synthesis. Organozinc reagents are important intermediates which display high reactivity and excellent chemoselectivity in organic $synthesis^{38-44}.$ Hence, we developed the bench-stable and easy-to-handle silyl and stannylzinc $reagents^{45,46},$ and applied to 3d cobalt-catalyzed cross- $couplings^{47-53}$ with polyfunctionalized alkenyl acetates to build synthetically useful C- $Si^{54-56}$ and C- $Sn^{57-60}$ bonds (Fig. 1d). In this work, $Me_{2}$ PhSiZnOPiv $\\cdot Li_{2}($ Cl)(OPiv) and $(^{n}Bu)_{3}$ Sn-ZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl show superior reactivity over the other commonly available Si- and Sn-based organometallic reagents. Moreover, notable features of our strategy are excellent functional group tolerance, and complete control of regio- and stereoselectivity, thus providing expedient access to the stereodefined alkenyl silanes and stannanes, which can be further utilized for the synthesis of stereochemically defined acyclic tri- and all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.\nResults\nOptimization studies\nWe initiated our studies by preparing different Si-Met (1) and Sn-Met(2) reagents (Met=Li, Mg, Zn, and Al) through transmetalation of corresponding Si-Li and Sn-Li reagents with $MgBr_{2}$ , $ZnX_{2}$ ,and Zn(OPiv) $_{2},$ or $AlCl_{3}.$ Thereafter, we tested their reactivity for the cobaltcatalyzed silylation and stannylation of alkenyl acetates via C-O bond activation (Fig. 2). To our delight, $CoBr_{2}$ in the presence of 2,2'-bipyridyl enables silylation of 3a using $Me_{2}$ PhSi-ZnOPiv $\\cdot Li_{2}($ Cl)(OPiv) (1a) as the nucleophile [PhMe2Si-ZnOPiv.2Li(OPiv)(Cl) was abbreviated as $Me_{2}$ PhSi-ZnOPiv for the sake of clarity], which displayed unique reactivity in carbonsilylation of alkenes by nickel $catalysis^{45},$ the\n2\nArticle\nFig. 2 | Cobalt-catalyzed C-O bond cleavage with different Si-Zn (1) and Sn-Zn equiv), $CoBr_{2}(10$ mol$\\%$),2,2'-bipyridine (bpy;11mol$\\%$), THF or MeCN (1.5mL),23 or(2).a Cobalt-catalyzed C-O silylation of 3a.b Cobalt-catalyzed C-O stannylation of $0 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ isolated yields.\n3b. Reaction conditions: 3a or 3b (0.25 mmol, 1.0 equiv), 1 or 2 (0.325 mmol,1.3\ndesired product 4 was obtained in 72$\\%$ yield. Interestingly, the typical halides-supported Si-Zn reagents 1b-1d, as well as Si-Mg reagent 1e failed to undergo the C-O silylation process under the identical cobalt catalysis. These findings are consistent with the previous nickelcatalyzed carbosilylation of alkenes, which demonstrated the crucial importance of OPiv-coordination for improving the reactivity of Si-Zn reagents. Furthermore. cross-coupling product was not observed in the treatment of Sn-Li (2d), Sn-Zn (2b), or Sn-Al (2 f) with indenyl acetate (3b) in the presence of $CoBr_{2}/2,2'-$ bipyridine (10 mol$\\%$) in MeCN at $0 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} .$ Whereas a two-step sequence including cobaltcatalyzed stannylation and nucleophilic addition/elimination occur red when employing Sn-Mg (2e) as the nucleophile, affording the bisstannylated product 5 in 24$\\%$ yield. The envisioned alkenyl stannane 7 was obtained using Sn-Zn 2a or 2c as the nucleophiles, and thus ( $nBu_{3})$ Sn-ZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl yielding the desired product 7 in 20$\\%$ yield, along with 24$\\%$ of the destannylative product 6.\nThese results encouraged us to further optimize the reaction conditions for cobalt-catalyzed C-Si and C-Sn bonds formation using $Me_{2}$ PhSi-ZnOPiv $\\cdot Li_{2}($ CI)(OPiv)(1a) and $(^{n}Bu)_{3}$ Sn-ZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl(2a) as the nucleophilic partners (Table 1). Firstly, optimization studies identified THF as the ideal reaction medium and bipyridine(L1) or 5,5'-dimethylbipyridine (L4) as the ligands of choice for the cobalt-catalyzed C-O silylation, leading to the desired alkenyl silane 4 in 81$\\%$ yield (Table la, entries 1-8). Lowering the temperature or employing other cobalt complexes as the catalyst gave moderate yieids (entries 9-12). However, examination with a metal source such as nickel, iron, or chromium salts provided only a negligible conversion, as was also observed in the absence of a catalyst (entries 13-14). After extensive optimization of ligands, such as bis(pyridine) s (L1-L7), tridentate 2,6-bis(N-pyrazoly $\\bar{i})$ pyridine (L8) phosphines(L9-L11), and bipyridine (L1) gave the optimal conversion of 7(Table 1b, entries 1-11). Meanwhile, MeCN was identified as the ideal medium of choice (entry 12). Switching from $CoBr_{2}$ to $NiCl_{2}, FeCl_{2}.$ or $CrCl_{2}$ failed to improve the transformation (entry 13). A significant breakthrough was made when performed the reaction at $-20 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C}$ , affording 7 in 53$\\%$ yield, while no reaction was observed at $-30 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} C$ (entry 14). Notably, shortening the reaction time to 15 min led to a further yield increase to 66$\\%$ yield (entries 15-16), which highlighted the robustness of the cobalt catalyst and unique reactivity of $(^{n}Bu)_{3}$ Sn-ZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl reagent (2a).\nSubstrate scope studies\nWith the optimized cobalt catalyst in hand, the generality of our protocol was subsequently explored in a range of C-O bond-silylation reactions with various polyfunctionalized alkenyl acetates 5 and solid silylzinc pivalate PhMe2Si-ZnOPiv (1a) (Fig. 3). We were pleased to find that cyclic and various all-carbon tetrasubstituted acyclic alkenyl acetates smoothly proceeded cobalt-catalyzed C-O bond-silylation with la under the otherwise identical reaction conditions. The solid PhMe2Si-ZnOPiv (1a) exhibited good reactivity under remarkably mild reaction conditions at $23 \\space ^\\circ\\text{C} ,$ thereby delivering the corresponding tetrasubstituted alkenyl silanes 9-30 in 50-86$\\%$ yields. Importantly, the cobalt catalysis displayed excellent functional group compatibility, such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, ester, nitrile, acetate, piperidine, and alkenyl substituents, were well tolerated under the mild reaction conditions. Notably, the catalytic system showed excellent chemoselectivity to realize C-O bond activation, rather than C-Hal (Cl and Br) cross-couplings. Moreover, the C-O bond cleavage of all-carbon tetrasubstituted acyclic alkenyl acetates 5 smoothly underwent a silylation process in a highly stereoretentive fashion, the corresponding (Z)alkenyl silanes 9-31 were obtained with excellent stereoselectivity. A similar result was also observed when employing (Z)-alkenyl acetate bearing a lactone fragment as the electrophile, furnishing the (Z)-stereoisomer 32 as the sole product in 81$\\%$ yield, which could be further reduced to the ring-opening diol 33 in a stereoretentive fashion. In sharp contrast, the lactam substrate failed to deliver the silylated product. The trisubstituted acyclic acetates failed to generate the desired product because a significant amount of the corresponding hydrodesilylated product 34 was formed, which is likely owing to the poor stability of the alkenyl silane under the reaction conditions.\nOn the basis of the remarkably high stereoselectivity and efficacy of the C-O bond-silylations, we subsequently succeeded in examing analogous stannylations of various alkenyl acetates with ( $nBu_{3})$ SnZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl (2a). Indeed, a variety of cyclic enol acetates, including indenyl acetate, naphthalenyl acetate, chromenyl acetate, as well as cyclopentenyl and cycloheptenyl acetates, were smoothly stannylated with 2a, delivering the alkenyl stannanes 7, 35-39 in 47-85$\\%$ yields. Moreover, the desired C-O bond stannylation can be successfully scaled up to the gram scale with a slightly reduced yield (38) (Fig. 4a).\nFurthermore, we turned our attention to examining the stereoselective transformation of our cobalt catalysis. It is worth noting that the (Z)-alkenyl acetates underwent cobalt-catalyzed stannylation in a stereoretentive fashion, generating the (Z)-stereoisomer as the sole product. As expected, various trisubstituted acrylates bearing electron-rich as well as electron-deficient substituents on the aryl side were identified as viable substrates for direct stannylations under remarkably mild reaction conditions, furnishing the (Z)-diastereomers 40-51 in 49-78$\\%$ yields through excellent chemo- and stereoselective C-O bond activation. Moreover, a variety of valuable functional groups such as trifluoromethyl, ester, nitrile, and terminal alkene were well\n3\nArticle\n4\nArticle\nFig. 3 | Substrate scope for stereoretentive C-O bond silylation.

A similar result was also observed when employing (Z)-acetoxyheptenyl carboxylate as the electrophilic partner, giving the desired product 52 in 76$\\%$ yield (Fig. 4b).\nToward the stereoselective preparation of more challenging unsymmetrical all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes, a series of stereodefined all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenyl acetates were investigated. To our delight, a range of all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenyl acetates bearing different functional groups smoothly underwent the cobalt-catalyzed C-O bond stannylation to afford the desired products 53-68 in 47-84$\\%$ yields with complete control of stereoselectivity. It is worth noting that tertiary amide, lactam, as well as lactone were found to be effective chelation groups for the envisioned stereoselective C-O bond-stannylation reaction, thereby providing(Z)-selective 69-72 as the sole products (Fig. 4b).\nIn order to further illustrate the potential applications of our protocol in the late-stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceutically active molecules. The alkenyl acetates derivatives of cholesterol, lithocholic acid, and citronellol were proven to be viable substrates for cobalt-catalyzed C-O silylation with PhMe2Si-ZnOPiv(1a), delivering the corresponding alkenyl silanes 73-76 in moderate yields with high (Z)-selectivity. Moreover, the enol acetates derivatives of citronellol, ibuprofen, probenecid, celecoxib, and indomethacin were well stannylated with $(^{n}Bu)_{3}$ Sn-ZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl, leading to the (Z)-diastereomers 77-81 in 47-71$\\%$ yields, thus displaying the potential utility of this technology to drug discovery in medicinal chemistry (Fig. 5).\nMechanistic studies\nInspired by the high reactivity of the PhMe2Si-ZnOPiv(1a) and $(^{n}Bu)_{3}$ Sn-ZnCl $\\cdot$ LiCl (2a) for cobalt-catalyzed stereoselective C-O bond silyl- and stannylation of alkenyl acetates, we sought to unravel the reaction mechanism. To this end, a series of control experiments with radical scavengers 82 were performed, and both silylated and stannylated products were isolated with slightly reduced yields (Fig. 6a). We next set the parallel reactions with stereodefined(Z)-and(E)alkenyl acetates, substrate (Z)-83 afforded the stereoretentive product 84 in 86$\\%$ yield, whereas the resulting products were detected by GC analysis with an E/Z ratio of 5.4:1 when employing (E)-83 as the electrophile. Moreover, a (E)-alkenyl acetate (85) bearing a conjugated amide only delivered the desired product 86 in a negligible conversion(Fig. 6b). These findings suggested that the chelation-assisted oxidative insertion of cobalt into the C-O bond of (Z)-alkenyl acetates is preferred to (E)-alkenyl acetates. Intermolecular competition experiments with (Z)-and E-alkenyl acetates revealed (Z)-83 to be inherently more reactive (Fig. 6c). Switching from (Z)-87 to the more hindered substrate of (Z)-88 led to a significantly decreased yield of the\n5\nArticle\nstannylation: alkenyl acetates (0.25mmol, 1.0 equiv), 2a(0.325mmol, 1.3 equiv), $CoBr_{2}(10$ mol$\\%$),bpy(L1,11mol$\\%$),MeCN(1.5mL) $,-20 ^\\circ\\text{C} .[a]$ CoBr2andL1(15mol $$\\%$).[b]0 ^\\circ\\text{C} .[c]23 ^\\circ\\text{C} .[d]$ LiAIH4(1.5equiv), $Et_{2}O,0 ^\\circ\\text{C} .$\ncorresponding product 89 and 90 (0 and 31$\\%$) (Fig. 6d). In addition, the substrate bearing a conjugated N,N-dimethyl amide (Z)-91 only gave the desired stannane 93 in 43$\\%$ yield with complete control of geometry. Moreover, an enol acetate 94 bearing a conjugated nitrile was also examined under standard conditions. However, only a trace amount of silylated product 95 and a low yield of stannylated product 96 were formed. As expected, no desired C-O bond functionalization was observed when using the substrate without a conjugated ester group as the electrophilic coupling partner (see Supplementary Fig. ie). These findings suggested that the ester group is crucial to the stereoselective C-O bond activation due to its chelation-assistance and conjugation effect to active the $\\alpha , \\beta -$ unsaturated alkenyl acetate system (Fig. 6e).\nBased on our mechanistic studies and previous $insights^{26,29},a$ plausible mechanism for the cobalt-catalyzed stannylation of alkenyl acetates is proposed, as shown in Fig. 7. The Co(II) precatalyst is initially reduced to form an active $L_{n}$ Co'-species by the [Si/Sn]-ZnX (1a or 2a). Alkenyl acetate 3 then coordinates to the in situ formed $L_{n}Co^{-}$ species (A) with the assistance of ester chelation. The chelation effect can facilitate the oxidative addition of $Co^{\\prime}L_{n}$ into C-O bond, thus forming Co(alkenyl)(OAc) complex B as a single diastereomer. Subsequent coordination and transmetalation with [Si/Sn]-ZnX (1a or 2a) affords the intermediate D. Final reductive elimination of D releases the desired alkenyl silanes and stannanes in a stereoretentive fashion and regenerates the catalytically active cobalt species A to close the catalytic cycle.\nFinally, the synthetic utility of the resulting alkenyl silanes and stannanes was further described in the palladium-catalyzed Hiyama and Stille coupling reactions (Fig. 8). Remarkably, aryl halides bearing chloro, and sensitive ketone, aldehyde substituents were well coupled with various alkenyl silanes and stannanes under mild reaction conditions, delivering the arylated products 97-100 in moderate to excellent yields with complete control of stereoselectivity, the conformation of 100 was confirmed by X-ray crystal analysis. 1,3-Dienes are key important structural motifs of natural products with activities of relevance to biology $chemistry^{61,62}.$ Such building blocks could be expediently constructed by palladium-catalyzed stereoselective alkenyi-alkenyl coupling reactions; the desired 1,3-dienes 101-105 were\n6\nArticle\n- Modifications of natural products and durg derivatives\nFig. 5 | Late-stage functionalization of drugs and natural products by stereoretentive C-0 bond cleavage.

Cross-coupling of ketone ingly, the selectivity was largely dominated by the reaction temperature.\nDiscussion\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the utility of Si-Zn and Sn-Zn reagents for the efficient cobalt-catalyzed cross-coupling of alkenyl acetates through chelation-assisted C-O bond cleavage under mild reaction conditions, thus providing a practical and efficient strategy for the preparation of various tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenyl silanes and stannanes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the solid silylzinc pivalate and stannylzinc chloride showed excellent reactivity and chemoselectivity toward diverse alkenyl acetates, as well as an ample substrate scope and high functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanism studies suggested that the stereoselectivity presumably is caused by the chelation-assisted oxidative addition of cobalt to the C-O bond of alkenyl acetates. Finally, we have also illustrated the synthetical versatility of the polyfunctionalized alkenyl silanes and stannanes by the facile transformations of Hiyama and Stille reactions with complete control of stereoselectivity, such as arylation and alkenylation. Further development of the related applications with SiZn and Sn-Zn reagents are currently ongoing in our laboratory and will be reported in due course.\nMethods\nCobalt-catalyzed stereoselective C-O silylation and stannylation of alkenyl acetates\nTo an oven-dried 25 mL screw-cap tube equipped with a stir bar was vacuumed and backfilled with $N_{2}$ for three times.
