Delightfully, both pyrrole 3a and 3-oxazoline 4a could be observed. When using Zn(OTf)2 as the catalyst, products 3a and 4a could be obtained in 17 and 50% yields, respectively (entry 1). Further investigation on the metal salts or TfOH could not improve the yield of 3a (entries 2−8), while the yield of 4a could be increased to 63% in the presence of TfOH (entry 8). Subsequently, the solvents and catalyst loading were screened (Tables S7/S8 in the Supporting Information). Unfortunately, no better result was obtained. And 3-oxazoline was ultimately obtained in a 74% yield by increasing the loading of TfOH to 20 mol % and prolonging the reaction time to 48 h (entry 9). To further improve the yield of 3a, a series of bases were added. It was found that the inorganic bases showed better results than the organic ones (entries 10−16), offering 3a in a 67% yield when NaOH was added (entry 10). Finally, pyrrole 3a was isolated in an 81% yield by increasing the loading of NaOH to 1.2 equiv and prolonging the reaction time to 48 h.\"", "answer": "TfOH, NaOH"}
